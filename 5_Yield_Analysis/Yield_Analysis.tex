\chapter{Growth Yield Analysis}
\label{chap:yield_analysis}

Chapters~\ref{chap:growth} and \ref{chap:properties} showed how the \hkl{1 1 1} facet stabilisation method affects the internal composition and morphology of nanowires grown with the \acf{tase} process. These results, obtained on \hkl(0 0 1) and \hkl(1 1 0) \acf{soi} wafers with different device layer thicknesses, showed reliable growth rates and structural results. However, a quantitative analysis of the yield of this growth method is needed to understand its success rate better. 

This chapter presents the research my co-authors and I carried out and published in \cite{Brugnolotto2023_2, Brugnolotto2024}.

\end{figure}

The yield analysis will focus on samples \num{6} and \num{7}, grown on \hkl(1 1 0) \acs{soi} wafers, which were introduced in Sections~\ref{sec:s6} and \ref{sec:s7}, respectively. In particular, the yield calculations will involve single nucleation nanowires grown in arrays like those shown in Figure~\ref{subfig:110_design2}. These structures supported \num{66} nucleation sites each and were grown with 4 template widths: \qty{70}{nm}, \qty{140}{nm}, \qty{210}{nm}, and \qty{280}{nm}.

\subsection{Lithography masks}

Figure~\ref{fig:wafer_mask} shows the digital mask that was used during the \acs{tase} process in the \acf{ebl} definition of markers, micro-structures, and template openings and to fabricate the optical lithography mask used to create the marker protections, as explained in \ref{chap:tase}. Figure~\ref{subfig:mask_array} shows how a single \num{66}-nanowire array looks like in the \acs{ebl} mask. This single array is placed in a section, shown in Figure~\ref{subfig:mask_section}, of the chip, together with \num{23} others, totalling \num{6} array per nanowire size per section. Sections are further grouped in divisions, one of which, marked AA, is shown in Figure~\ref{subfig:mask_division}. Each division contains a total of \num{12} sections. Each of the sections is orientated so that the nanowires in each array and merge structure are closely aligned with one of the in-plane \hkl<1 1 1> directions, or \qty{30}{\degree} misaligned from them. This results in a series of fishbone patterns across the mask used to pattern the entire chip, shown in Figure~\ref{subfig:mask_chip}. The \qtyproduct{1.5 x 1.5}{\centi\metre} sample area of each chip, highlighted in yellow, contains \num{49} divisions, resulting in a total of \num{1254528} nanowire single nucleation sites (therefore, without taking into account the merge structures). 

Each section is identified by a number, in the case of the one in Figure~\ref{subfig:mask_section} it is \num{11}, and two letters that, in turn, identify the division of the mask in which it is found. Therefore, the naming convention defines, in order, the row and the column of the division within the chip, starting at the top left of Figure~\ref{subfig:mask_chip}, and the row and column of the section within the division, starting at the top left of each division. In this example, AA11 is the top-leftmost section in the entire chip.

A \acf{stem_m} analysis of every nanowire is impossible due to the damage caused by \acf{fib} lamella preparation to the area immediately surrounding each cut-out. Still, even if a single cut per array was performed, a total of \num{19008} lamellae would have to be manufactured and analysed per sample. This task is too time-consuming and resource-intensive to be viable. Therefore, a different approach must be found to tackle the problem of yield calculation.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Internal morphology and reproducibility in \acs{tase} nanowires}{Internal morphology and reproducibility in TASE nanowires}}

Stabilisation of a single \hkl{1 1 1} facet for the internal superlattice heterointerfaces of the nanowires was observed in all phosphide-arsenide samples since it was first achieved in sample 3 (Section~\ref{sec:s3}). Eliminating the ambiguity of facet selection due to the substrate \hkl(1 1 0) discussed in Section~\ref{sec:s4} limits the outcome of the \acf{tmah} etching to a single facet seed, a condition which is achieved reliably since sample 4. Similarly, from sample 4 onwards, the seed facet and the end facet of the wires have been parallel or showed a misalignment of \qty{3}{\degree} in sample 6 (Section~\ref{sec:s6}). Finally, with the minimisation of \acf{ingaas} nucleation layer thickness introduced in sample 5 (Section~\ref{sec:s5}) all important material layers are heterointerfaced with a single \hkl{1 1 1} facet.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:s7_OVs} shows four \acs{bf}-\acs{stem_m} overview images of the same number of nanowires from the lamella cut from sample 7. These images confirm the observations made in the previous paragraph regarding the relation between \acf{si} / III-V semiconductor interface and the nanowire end-facet shapes mirrored in all important interior phosphide-arsenide heterointerfaces. An approximation can therefore be made by inferring that if the \acl{si} seed consists of a single \hkl{1 1 1} facet, the III-V material fully covers it, and the end-wire surface is a single \hkl{1 1 1} facet parallel to the \acs{si} seed the internal morphology also developed as-desired, with \hkl{1 1 1} single-facet heterointerfaces. Therefore, these metrics can be used to define a perfect wire.

\end{figure}

These specifications do not require a full \acs{stem_m} analysis. Instead, a \acf{sem_m} survey of the arrays in the sample is sufficient to assess the growth yield. One such survey, resulting in an open access dataset \cite{dataset}, was carried out on samples 6 and 7. Figure~\ref{fig:s7_arrays} shows eight images of the arrays of sample 6 taken from this dataset. A first distinction can be made by "Perpendicular" wires, so-called because the heterointerfaces in perfect nanowires are perpendicular to all four template walls, and \qty{30}{\degree} misaligned wires, which owe their name to the tilt of the template channels from the \hkl{1 1 1} direction.

The dataset was collected manually using the \acs{sem_m} beam of the dual-beam \acs{sem_m} - \acs{fib} tool. Due to project time constraints, sampling became necessary to gather a full suite of images showing every one of the \num{19008} arrays. Five sections were selected in each chip, mostly at random. However, for sample 7, a perpendicular and a \qty{30}{\degree} misaligned section were selected in the AA division to ensure a representation of the border divisions of the chip. Another difference between the two samples is that while for sample 6, sections were randomly drafted and changed for each of the five positions, for sample 6, a second division was randomly selected, within which another two sections were imaged. The fifth and final section was once again randomly chosen. These sections are reported in Table~\ref{tab:dataset_sections}. Three parallel and two \qty{30}{\degree} misaligned sections were imaged for both samples.

\begin{table}

    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:dataset_sections}
\end{table}

This means that 240 arrays containing 15840 nucleation sites were imaged. This number represents \qty{0.63}{\percent} of the wires in the two chips. As such, it can be helpful to provide a first estimate of the yield, and for a dataset from which automated yield calculation methods can be built on.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\acs{sem_m}-observable defects in \acs{tase} nanowires}{SEM observable defects in TASE nanowires}}

Defective wires were marked with yellow arrows in the nanowire arrays of Figure~\ref{fig:s7_arrays}. All these defective wires can be detected by looking at the wire-end interface. None of the wires mirroring the defective wires are defective, except for two. Each defective wire is isolated, having no immediate defective neighbour. Some of the defective wires also have partially covered seeds, as is most evident in the two neighbouring \qty{280}{\nano\metre} \qty{30}{\degree} misaligned array. However, unideal nucleation is not the only reason for defective growth, as seen in the \qty{140}{\nano\metre} and \qty{280}{\nano\metre} perpendicular wires, which fully cover the \acl{si} seed.

The length of the nanowires does not change significantly with the change in width of the \acs{tase} templates, as can be seen by comparing the lengths of the nanowires in Figure~\ref{subfig:70nm_arrays} with those of the nanowires in Figure~\ref{subfig:140nm_arrays}, \ref{subfig:210nm_arrays}, and \ref{subfig:280nm_arrays}, once the slight magnification used for presentation purposes in Figure~\ref{subfig:70nm_arrays} is taken into account. Therefore, compared to their neighbours, abnormally long or short III-V material segments in some nucleation sites can indicate undesired defects in the wire's internal structure.

Two sites also contain defective wires. \subref{subfig:defects_oxide_nucleated} shows a template with nucleation on the \acs{si} seed, resulting in a small III-V particle, while the larger wire nucleated on the \acs{sio2} wall and grew out of the template.}
    \label{fig:defects}
\end{figure}

Loss of growth selectivity can negatively affect the yield of "perfect" nanowires. In Figure~\ref{subfig:defects_parasitic}, the large parasitic crystal in the centre of the image hides many nucleation sites from view. Parasitic crystals often grow in places where impurities or geometric features on the surface of the chip provide unwanted nucleation sites. The lack of nucleation at several growth sites shown in Figure~\ref{subfig:defects_unucleated} can be considered another "defect" because it does not produce a nanowire where one is expected. Lack of nucleation occurs when a \acs{sio2} layer covers the \acl{si} seed and, therefore, is caused by \acf{hf} not entirely stripping this passivating layer or being unable to reach it due, for example, to the presence of a bubble on the chip surface during the pre-growth \acs{hf} dip. In Figure~\ref{subfig:defects_unucleated}, this defect occurs in nucleation sites that share their template opening with "perfect" nanowires, making the bubble hypothesis less likely. Figure~\ref{subfig:defects_oxide_nucleated} shows a growth site where nucleation co-occurred on both the \acl{si} seed surface and the \acs{sio2} inner template wall. The crystal nucleated on the \acl{si} surface was quickly cut off from the precursor supply when the other crystal grew to fill the width of the template. The defective crystal then grew faster than the other crystals around it due to its starting point being closer to the template opening and the random crystalline orientation resulting from the nucleation on the template wall. Had the undesired nucleation occurred closer to the opening of the template, it could have resulted in a parasitic growth similar to that in Figure~\ref{subfig:defects_parasitic}.

The \num{240} array images discussed in the previous sections were manually examined. The resulting count revealed that \num{14660} wires out of \num{15840} nucleation sites grew "perfect", therefore satisfying all the criteria explained so far. This results in a total yield of \qty{92.55}{\percent} \cite{Brugnolotto2023_2}. The yield can be broken down between sample 6 and 7: for sample 6, \qty{91.59}{\percent} of the wires, or \num{7254} out of \num{7920}, grew perfectly, a figure that grows to \qty{93.51}{\percent}, or \num{7406} out of \num{7920} for sample 7. Despite \acs{inp}-lattice-matched arsenide layers being the only type of heterolayer in sample 6 and mismatched \acf{inas} layers being present in sample 7, the total yield is very similar for both samples, showing that lattice mismatch had no impact on this metric.

The \num{1180} defective wires are broken down between the two samples and by defect category in Table~\ref{tab:defects_overview}. The seven defect classes are: "wrong facet", which comprises the wires where the end interface is not parallel to the \hkl{1 1 1} seed interface, "hidden by parasitic", counting the nucleation sites that are covered by a parasitic crystal and therefore not visible, "oxide nucleated", which counts the wires that nucleated on the template oxide, "seed exposed" wires have the correct end surface but did not fully cover the seed surface, "long" and "short" wires are only defective in terms of length when compared to those around them, and "ungrown" wires, or lack of wires, counts the nucleation sites that did not experience growth.

The three most numerous categories for total number of defects are "hidden by parasitic", "wrong facet", and "short", with totals of \num{487}, \num{368}, and \num{211}, respectively. The other categories are one order of magnitude lower. The category "hidden by parasitic" is different from the others in the sense that a single defect hides multiple wires, close to \num{15}, or \num{14.87} on average, from view, as shown in Figure~\ref{subfig:defects_parasitic}. As such, the status of the hidden wires is unknown. If these hidden nucleation sites are ignored for the purposes of yield calculation, the total number of surveyed sites falls to \num{15379}, while the number of perfect wires remains unchanged. Under this approximation, the total yield rises by \qty{2.77}{\percent} to \qty{95.32}{\percent}.

Data on defective wires can also be divided between perpendicular and \qty{30}{\degree} misaligned growth sites, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:defects_overview_sites}. The total number of perpendicular growth sites surveyed is \num{9504} (\qty{60}{\%} of the total): higher than the number of \qty{30}{\degree} misaligned sites, which is \num{6336} (\qty{40}{\%} of the total). This is caused by three out of five sections containing perpendicular growth sites for both samples. As a result, the total number of defects in the perpendicular sections is expected to be higher if the same possibility of defective wire presence is expected. However, suppose the presence of a tilted seed surface is expected to be a disadvantage for the growth of perfect wires. In that case, this should be reflected in an equal or higher number of defective wires for the misaligned sites.

A first count of the total number of defective wires points to this conclusion, with \num{564} (\qty{47.8}{\%} of the total) defective wires for the perpendicular growth sites and \num{616} (\qty{52.2}{\%} of the total) for the \qty{30}{\degree} misaligned sections. However, when breaking down the defects into each category, it becomes apparent that a third of all defects in the \qty{30}{\degree} misaligned growth sites are in the short category, which is two orders of magnitude larger compared to the perpendicular growth sites. This was caused by the nucleation sites of section GG31 in sample 6 presenting numerous nucleation and growth issues, reflected in the higher number of short and ungrown wires. This could be ascribed to the different orientations of the \acl{si} seed but could just as easily be due to characteristics of the seed, such as residual oxide cover, or of the precursor flow over the sample, independent of geometry.

Four of the other five categories closely follow the expected defect ratios between the two types of nucleation sites, which comprise the other two categories with more than \num{100} defective wires. The presence of parasitic crystals is purely stochastic, and given that they can vary in size, the \qty{64.7}{\%} / \qty{35.3}{\%} split in this category is expected. However, the split in the "wrong facet" category is the most indicative of the actual difference in the performance of the facet stabilisation method, as it concentrates on analysing the relationship between the shapes of the seed and end-wire interface. This \qty{56.5}{\%} / \qty{43.5}{\%} split denotes a slight prevalence of defective wires for the \qty{30}{\degree} misaligned sites, but remains close to the \num{60} / \num{40} split of the sample sizes.

The arrays on the left contain structures grown from a seed surface parallel to the template direction, while those on the right are grown from seed surfaces that are tilted concerning the template. On the bottom left of the images, the three main elements of the arrays are highlighted in green (silicon seed), red (III-V nanowires), and blue (template opening).}

% Figure~\ref{fig:arrays} shows growth results from sample 1 of arrays containing template nanotubes of four different widths (\qty{70}{nm}, \qty{140}{nm}, \qty{210}{nm}, and \qty{280}{nm}). Each array contains 66 nanowires (in red) grown from silicon (in green) and arranged in 33 pairs. Each pair of wires shares the same template opening (in blue). 
% \par
% Each wire in the array can be identified by its row, opening, and position relative to the latter. Each row is numbered from 1 to 11, starting at the bottom of the array. The template openings are marked by letters A, B, or C; the wires connected to the opening to the left (l) or right (r) can be easily distinguished. Therefore, a string such as 9Br identifies a single wire in the array. 
% \par
% Our growth methodology aims to select and maintain a single \hkl{111}\(_B\) facet as the nanowire's growth front. If a III-V wire end-surface is multi-faceted or not parallel to the \acs{si} seed facet, the wire is classified as defective in this study without requiring a further in-depth STEM analysis. This first distinction allows the evaluation of the fraction of "perfect" wires, defining a growth yield. 
% \par
% In Figure~\ref{fig:arrays}, the \qty{280}{nm} tilted arrays present some defective wires in 11Al, 6Cr, and 7Cr; however, the other wires in each pair (11Ar, 6Cl, and 7Cl) appear “perfect”. As is evident in the case of wire 6Cr, the wire grew into an unpredictable shape after nucleation. It is unclear if the source of defective wires can be attributed solely to the nucleation step, as there are other sites (\qty{70}{nm} tilted 6Cl, \qty{140}{nm} perpendicular 2Br, 11Br, and \qty{280}{nm} perpendicular 7Br) that present a defective wire and fully covered seed. However, this finding suggests that nucleation does play an important role in the following growth facet selection.

(b) multiple seeds do not show nucleation of III-V material at all, while one site shows parasitic nucleation inside the template. (c) in the bottom row, after initial nucleation on the \acs{si}, a parasitic crystal developed inside the template and grew out of it.}
%     \label{fig:failures}
% \end{figure}

% Another parameter that negatively affects the growth yield is the loss of growth selectivity and the resulting parasitic growth. This is ascribed to impurities or surface features promoting nucleation. An example of this is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:defects}.a, where a single defect of this kind affects many wires. Figure~\ref{fig:defects}.b also shows sites where parasitic nucleation occurred within templates and, seed-sites that did not undergo III-V on \acs{si} nucleation, likely because of the lingering of a passivating \acs{sio2} layer on the \acs{si} seed surface. This happened despite the proximity to other correctly-grown wires. Finally, 
% Figure~\ref{fig:defects}.c bottom row illustrates an example where, after the initial nucleation event, the channel was obstructed by a parasitic nucleation growth within the channel, which extends outside the template. This type of growth configuration can potentially cause deposits similar to that in Figure~\ref{fig:defects}.a.

% A survey of the arrays was carried out using samples 1 and 2, and involved \num{15840} individual nanowires grown in \num{240} arrays grouped in \num{5} locations per sample. The areas investigated were the top left of the chips as well as randomly selected locations throughout it. Wires need to have two parallel visible \hkl{111} seed and end facets of equal length, and they need to have nucleated directly on the \acs{si} seed covering it in its entirety for them to be considered "perfect". Of the \num{15840} total wires \num{14660} match these criteria, totalling a global yield of \qty{92.55}{\%}.
% \par
% Of the \num{7920} wires imaged for each sample, \num{7254} grew successfully in sample 1, and \num{7406} grew successfully in sample 2, resulting in a corresponding growth yield of \qty{91.59}{\%} and \qty{93.51}{\%}. This result indicates that the different heterointerfaces of samples 1 and 2 do not significantly impact the growth yield. 
% \par
% Further analysis was carried out within each sample by comparing the template growth yield parallel to the \hkl<111> direction, and those tilted away from it. A larger number (\num{9504} out of \num{15840}) of wires of the first configuration were measured. For sample 2, the parallel and tilted configurations resulted in comparable growth yields of \qty{93.73}{\%} and \qty{93.75}{\%}, while sample 1 showed \qty{94.84}{\%} and \qty{86.71}{\%} growth yields for the same configurations. The larger difference in growth yields for parallel and tilted templates in sample 1 can be explained by one of the fivcategorisedselected locations containing tilted arrays, falling in an area of the chip with many nucleation issues. This area is reflected in Table~\ref{tab:failures} where sample 1 has more short and ungrown wires.
% \par
% The total of \num{1180} nanowires that experienced growth failure are categorised based on the type of failure they experienced. Table~\ref{tab:failures} breaks down the number of defective wires for each sample between parallel and tilted templates, on a per-category basis. The first category, labelled "wrong facet", groups wires which terminate with either a multi-faceted surface or in a single facet that is not parallel to the seed surface, and accounts for \num{368} wires (\qty{31.2}{\%} of the total defective wires). The second and largest category comprises wire locations hidden by a parasitic crystal (\num{461} wires or \qty{39.0}{\%} of the total failures). From a total of \num{240} arrays, \num{32} are affected by one or more parasitic crystals. Still, the parasitic crystals hide close to \num{15} (\num{14.87} on average) locations for nanowire growth in each of these arrays. The "oxide nucleated" category contains all the cases where a III-V crystal nucleated randomly inside a template instead on the \acs{si} seed and counts \num{17} wires, \qty{1.4}{\%} of the total. The wires in the category "seed exposed" have the expected end facet, but did not fully cover the entire seed surface, leaving some of it exposed (\num{8} wires, \qty{0.7}{\%}). The category "long" comprises wires that were significantly longer than the others but did not have other defects, accounting for \qty{0.7}{\%} of the defective wires for a total of \num{8}. The last two categories are abnormally short wires and ungrown wires, with \num{211} (\qty{20.1}{\%}) and \num{81} (\qty{6.9}{\%}) counts each. These two categories of wires are more common in the area which presented nucleation iCharacterisation1.
