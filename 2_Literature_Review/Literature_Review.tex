CHAPTER SUMMARY

\section{A tale of two particles}

If the reader asks a common person in the street what "electronics" means they will receive a variety of responses centred on computers, smartphones, television sets, and other everyday appliances. On the other hand, if the same interviewee demographic was asked about "photonics", some might mention \acl{led}s (\acs{led}s) and lasers, others might cite Star Trek or other science-fiction work. The term photonics has not found widespread understanding outside the semiconductor industry, despite these two technologies often being separated by around a decade and a half in the research and development stages. 

The basic building block of modern electronics, the transistor, was invented in 1947 \cite{Bardeen1948, Bardeen1950}. Pointing to a direct equivalent in the history of photonics is not straightforward; however, the first solid-state light-emitting device was described just \num{15} years later in 1962 \cite{Biard1966} and consisted of a \acf{gaas} \acs{led} emitting in the infrared. Interest in solid-state lasing grew immediately after this discovery \cite{Hall1962, Hall1963} affirming the role of III-V semiconductors as solid-state light emitters. The next year, in 1963, Wanlass invented \acf{cmos} technology \cite{Wanlass1967} cementing integrated planar electronics as the main computational platform of the second half of the century. It took four years after this seminal invention for the idea of a \acf{pic} to follow \cite{Miller1969}.

Therefore, while integrated electronics was entering its exponential phase, exemplified by Moore's law \cite{Moore1965}, itself formulated in the mid-1960s, the building blocks of photonics were just being discovered or still in a conceptual phase. This led to a difference in investment that, in turn, shaped the technological landscape of humanity. While commercial electron-based technologies were progressing through small-, medium- and large-scale integration, up until very large-scale, photon-based technology was mostly commercialised for, initially highly specialised, lighting and solid-state lasers, until the discovery of the blue \acs{led} in the 1990s \cite{Nakamura1994}. This decade, however, saw a new revolution, the introduction and rapid diffusion of the Internet. This new technology exposed the limitation of the electron as an information-carrying particle. Impedance losses and inductive currents can be sidestepped simply by choosing to transmit information with pulses of light, because fibre optic is much less lossy a support than copper wires, and induction is an issue specific to the electron. This was quite quickly implemented in long-range communication infrastructure, but this technology has been proposed in integrated interconnects since the late 1980s \cite{Miller1989}.

In integrated interconnects, the use of photons bypasses some important problems affecting electrical lines, such as the "aspect ratio limit" that binds the maximum amount of bits per second to the shape of the interconnect \cite{Miller1997}, the dependence of clock timing on temperature, cross-talk between neighbouring interconnects, and the transition between high impedance electronic components and low impedance electronic interconnects, while providing voltage isolation and potential for free space interconnects \cite{Miller1997_reasons}. All of these problems also have electrical solutions, but these solutions in turn increase the energy requirements and therefore the energy loss that occurs on the circuit board, and there is a limit to how much heat can be cost-efficiently extracted from each singular chip; therefore, photonics becomes attractive from both an energy- and a cost-efficiency point of view \cite{Miller2009}, provided that the integration method allows for such an efficiency. 

Indeed, integration is the key step enabling photonics, the initial photonic circuits of the late 1980s and 1990s were realised directly on \acf{inp} wafers from \num{2} inches to \num{4} inches in diameter. Despite the small size, these are very expensive supports compared to the much larger \qty{150}{\milli\metre} and \qty{200}{\milli\metre} \acl{si} supports their contemporary. This technology managed to demonstrate very large scale integration by the mid 2010s, after which it was surpassed by both \acl{si} and III-V on \acl{si} photonic integrated circuits \cite{Shekhar2024, Margalit2021}.

III-V semiconductors are compound semiconductors formed by the stoichiometric combination of elements from group III and group V of the periodic table. In their most simple form they are binary, or consisting of one element from group III and one from group V, with some examples being \acs{inp} and \acs{gaas}. Ternary and quaternary III-V materials such as \ce{In1_-_xGa_xAs} or \ce{In1_-_xGa_xAs1_-_yP_y} contain three or four different elements, respectively. 

Crystallographically, III-V materials are available at room temperature in crystals with the symmetries of space group number \num{216} (F\(\bar{4}\)3m, or zincblende-like) or \num{186} (P6\(_3\)mc, or wurtzite-like) and are easily affected by polytypism when grown. Space group \num{216} is that of a cubic face-centred crystal, while space group \num{186} describes a hexagonal crystal. These two structures are closely related, as the addition of a two-fold axis alongside the three-fold axis of space group \num{216} results in a phase change to space group \num{186}, transforming the \hkl<1 1 1> direction in the zincblende phase to the \hkl<0 0 0 1> direction in the wurtzite phase. 

Figure~\ref{fig:ZB_low_index_facets} shows the 2D projections of a \acs{gaas} F\(\bar{4}\)3m crystal along the low-index directions. These projections are useful for the interpretation of atomic-resolution microscopy images of III-V semiconductors. These simulated projections were created using CrystalKit, a dedicated software. They also highlight the main symmetry elements of the zincblende space group. The 2D projection in Figure~\ref{subfig:GaAs_100} shows how a \hkl{0 0 1} facet appears in the microscope. The symmetry element controlling its motif is a four-fold axis perpendicular to the projection plane. Similarly, Figure~\ref{subfig:GaAs_110} shows how a \hkl{1 1 0} facet appears in the microscope and the mirror plane dictating its symmetry. Finally, Figure~\ref{subfig:GaAs_111} shows the lattice projected along the \hkl<1 1 1> direction. The symmetry of this projection is compatible with a three-fold axis coinciding with the \hkl<1 1 1> vector.

Although the orientation of the low index facets with respect to each other is difficult to properly convey on a 2D support, Figure~\ref{fig:facet_relations} shows how the three different facets, \hkl{0 0 1} in orange, \hkl{1 1 0} in light blue, and \hkl{1 1 1} in purple, are orientated in a cubic crystal. The shapes of the polygons that make up the figure also give a hint as to what kind of symmetry element is present in each facet. Figure~\ref{subfig:100_symmetry} can also be used to understand the relationship between different planes in the cubic \acl{si} crystal of the \hkl(0 0 1) \acf{soi} device layer used as seed in Chapter~\ref{chap:growth}.

Figure~\ref{fig:GaAs_rtp} shows a drawing of a \acf{rtp} corresponding to a \hkl{1 1 1} plane in a \acs{gaas} F\(\bar{4}\)3m crystal. Formation of this type of 2D defect is common in the growth of III-V crystals \cite{Borg2017} and its quantity is very sensitive to changes in the growth environment \cite{Algra2008, Chi2013} due to its low formation energy. From a lattice symmetry point of view, the \acs{rtp} is formed by adding a two-fold rotation axis to the \hkl{1 1 1} direction of the crystal. The two atomic bilayers adjacent to the \acs{rtp} can be considered a thin slice of wurtzite \cite{Glas2007, Vedel2022}.

Both atomic species and lattice symmetry affect the electronic properties of crystals. Bloch functions are the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian that describe a particle in a periodic potential \cite{Dirl2005}, and pose the basis for understanding the behaviour of electrons in crystals. They are also periodic functions, and in reciprocal space they are used to describe the electronic band structure, resulting in plots such as those in Figure~\ref{fig:band_structure}. The band structures in this figure were plotted by Christian Dam Vedel; the vertical axis shows the energy and is centred around the Fermi energy, which is the energy at the midpoint between the last occupied state and the first unoccupied state at \qty{0}{\kelvin} (thermal zero). The horizontal axis shows wavevectors along certain high-symmetry directions in the unit cell of the reciprocal lattice: the Brillouin zone \cite{Setyawan2010}. The energy of each of the states along the one-dimensional paths that link these points is then plotted. Therefore, in Figure~\ref{fig:band_structure}, the states below the Fermi energy are part of the valence band and those above it are part of the conduction band. 

The $\Gamma$ point is the centre of the Brillouin zone and is very important for understanding photon-driven electronic transitions between bands. Indeed, due to momentum conservation rules, a single photon can only cause what are called centrezone transitions, which are transitions between states that both are at the $\Gamma$ point. Interband transitions outside of the centrezone require a third particle, usually a phonon, to mediate the transition, changing the type of interaction from 2-particle to 3-particle, a type of interaction which has a lower probability of occurring. This means that if the minimum of the conduction band and the maximum of the valence band are at the $\Gamma$ point, a material has a better chance to promote an electron when it is hit by a photon at the band gap energy. A material with this type of band structure is said to have a direct band gap. Conversely, a material that has a band structure with the minimum of the conduction band at a wavevector that is different from the wavevector of the maximum of the valence band is said to have an indirect band gap. Similarly, the radiative relaxation pathway is prevalent in direct band-gap semiconductors and non-radiative relaxation paths are prevalent in indirect band-gap semiconductors, affecting the light-emitting properties of these materials.

III-V semiconductors have direct band gaps, as exemplified by those of the zincblende and wurtzite phases of  \acl{inp} shown in Figures~\ref{subfig:ZB_bands_InP} and \ref{subfig:WZ_bands_InP}. As such, they are highly efficient light emitters and absorbers. In contrast, \acl{si} has an indirtect bandgap, as shown in Figure~\ref{subfig:Si_bands}, making it an ill-suited material for light emission and absorption.











\section{\texorpdfstring{III-V-on-\acs{si} integration routes}{III-V-on-Si integration routes}}
The various integration routes of III-V semiconductors on Si can be divided in two broad categories: heterogeneous and homogeneous integration.

CHANGE TO TRANSFER AND MONOLITHIC GROWTH

\subsection{Heterogeneous integration}
Heterogeneous integration refers to the indirect integration of III-V material grown on a different, lattice matched, substrate on a Si wafer. 
\par
The main advantage of these techniques is the elimination of lattice mismatch as a source of defects during epitaxial growth. Furthermore, it allows the selection of the best-performing structures to be transferred onto the Si substrate \cite{Zadeh2016, Wang2017}, and does not have to compromise on the growth parameters or material systems for the sake of CMOS compatibility (except for bonding temperature). The various methods that fall under this definition form, all together, a mature technology that already finds application in industry4, therefore benefitting from a few years of industrial optimisation.
\par
On the other hand, this type of integration requires the growth of III-V to take place in a different fabrication line that must maintain the high precision and cleanliness standard of the main CMOS silicon line, resulting in a rather large capital investment. Furthermore, most classic transfer steps can result in a material with a more irregular geometry (wafer bow, surface roughness after etching), or presenting transfer-related defects \cite{Jevtics2022}, or require an extra bonding layer \cite{Jevtics2022, Tang2019}, and do not allow for nm precise integration \cite{Wang2017, McPhillimy2020}. However, the most advanced techniques that bypass most of these quality issues are too slow to provide a competitive transfer time for large, densely integrated 8' production wafers \cite{Wang2017, McPhillimy2020}.
\subsection{Homogeneous Integration}
Homogeneous integration refers to the direct integration by epitaxial growth of III-V semiconductors on Si. 
It naturally provides advantages such as the extremely high spatial precision and accuracy for the integration of small devices on wafer-scale substrates, which can be achieved in a shorter time frame compared to its heterogeneous analogues \cite{Wang2017}. It has the potential of being a more economical alternative to heterogeneous integration. If the growth process can be integrated with current CMOS processes, its implementation in a CMOS line would render having an entire dedicated III-V fab running in parallel with a Si-based fab unnecessary, especially if the use of III-V electronics is envisioned at the same time as III-V photonics \cite{Wang2017}, therefore potentially reducing the capital cost required to implement this efficient light-emitting and -absorbing material in different devices \cite{Tang2019}.
The main disadvantage is related to the high lattice mismatch between Si and most III-V materials, meaning strain-relaxing defects are nucleated at the heterointerface \cite{Kunert2018}: these defects have a very detrimental effect on the performance and lifetime of devices \cite{Mahajan2000, Zenari2021}, and act as scattering or recombination centres \cite{Jeon2015}. The polar nature of III-V atomic bonds compared to nonpolar Si-Si bonds can create anti-phase boundaries during growth on certain Si facets \cite{Kunert2018}, and most known surface treatments to eliminate the nucleation sites for these defects occur in temperature ranges that are incompatible with the CMOS process \cite{Miller2000}. Furthermore, materials that are known to grow at a higher temperature, such as III – nitrides, and others that could have detrimental effects on the passivating of SiO2 layers, such as gallium \cite{Miller2000}, also pose compatibility problems with the CMOS process. Another key obstacle, especially related to the direct growth of micro- and nanostructures, is the stricter requirements for the reproducibility and reliability of the process.
\subsection{Comparison between homogeneous integration routes}
What follows is a table comparing the advantages and disadvantages of various homogeneous integration techniques. The table predominantly focusses on what can be accomplished in the growth reactor and briefly mentions techniques that require simple or complex substrate preparation.

It should be noted that often, in papers from Dr. Lau’s group, the growth method they use is called lateral aspect ratio trapping (LART) \cite{Han2020, Yan2021}: this is in essence a hybrid between SAG-ART and TASE, and can be described as a type of TASE with particularly wide (sometimes several micrometres) templates, therefore I have grouped it with TASE in the above table. It should be noted, however, that while LART offers most of the same advantages that TASE offers, it is more susceptible to the formation of grain boundaries due to multiple nucleation (which does not take place in TASE) and has reduced defect trapping in the wide direction. On the other hand, due to their etch-based approach, they can achieve more intricate quantum well positioning in their microdisk lasers than what is possible with our TASE approach for microdisk growth.

\section{Article 2}

Due to the presence of the SiO2 template, the quantum wells
develop only axially and not laterally. This results in improved
composition control in heterolayers of ternary III-V
compounds incorporated in the nanowires\cite{Borg2019} and therefore is
expected to allow for better control of the emission spectra.
