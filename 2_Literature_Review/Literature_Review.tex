\section{\texorpdfstring{III-V-on-\acs{si} integration routes}{III-V-on-Si integration routes}}
The various integration routes of III-V semiconductor on Si can be at first divided in 2 broad categories: heterogeneous and homogeneous integration.
\subsection{Heterogeneous integration}
Heterogeneous integration refers to the indirect integration of III-V material grown on a different, lattice matched, substrate on a Si wafer. 
\par
The main advantage of these techniques is the elimination of lattice mismatch as a source of defects during epitaxial growth. Furthermore, it allows the selection of the best performing structures to be transferred onto the Si substrate \cite{Zadeh2016, Wang2017}, and does not have to compromise on the growth parameters or material systems for the sake of CMOS compatibility (except for bonding temperature). The various methods that fall under this definition form, all together, a mature technology that already finds application in industry4, therefore benefitting from a few years of industrial optimisation.
\par
On the other hand, this type of integration requires the growth of III-V to take place in a different fabrication line that must maintain the high precision and cleanliness standard of the main CMOS silicon line, resulting in a rather large capital investment. Furthermore, most classic transfer steps can result in a material with a more irregular geometry (wafer bow, surface roughness after etching), or presenting transfer-related defects \cite{Jevtics2022}, or require an extra bonding layer \cite{Jevtics2022, Tang2019}, and do not allow for nm precise integration \cite{Wang2017, McPhillimy2020}. However, the most advanced techniques that bypass most of these quality issues are too slow to provide a competitive transfer time for large, densely integrated 8' production wafers \cite{Wang2017, McPhillimy2020}.
\subsection{Homogeneous Integration}
Homogeneous integration refers to the direct integration by epitaxial growth of III-V semiconductors on Si. 
It naturally provides advantages such as the extremely high spatial precision and accuracy for the integration of small devices on wafer-scale substrates, which can be achieved in a shorter time frame compared to its heterogeneous analogues \cite{Wang2017}. It has the potential of being a more economical alternative to heterogeneous integration. If the growth process can be integrated with current CMOS processes, its implementation in a CMOS line would render having an entire dedicated III-V fab running in parallel with a Si-based fab unnecessary, especially if the use of III-V electronics is envisioned at the same time as III-V photonics \cite{Wang2017}, therefore potentially reducing the capital cost required to implement this efficient light-emitting and -absorbing material in different devices \cite{Tang2019}.
The main disadvantage is related to the high lattice mismatch between Si and most III-V materials, meaning strain-relaxing defects are nucleated at the heterointerface \cite{Kunert2018}: these defects have a very detrimental effect on the performance and lifetime of devices \cite{Mahajan2000, Zenari2021}, and act as scattering or recombination centres \cite{Jeon2015}. The polar nature of III-V atomic bonds compared to nonpolar Si-Si bonds can create anti-phase boundaries during growth on certain Si facets \cite{Kunert2018}, and most known surface treatments to eliminate the nucleation sites for these defects occur in temperature ranges that are incompatible with the CMOS process \cite{Miller2000}. Furthermore, materials that are known to grow at a higher temperature, such as III – nitrides, and others that could have detrimental effects on the passivating of SiO2 layers, such as gallium \cite{Miller2000}, also pose compatibility problems with the CMOS process. Another key obstacle, especially related to the direct growth of micro- and nanostructures, is the stricter requirements for the reproducibility and reliability of the process.
\subsection{Comparison between homogeneous integration routes}
What follows is a table comparing the advantages and disadvantages of various homogeneous integration techniques. The table predominantly focusses on what can be accomplished in the growth reactor and briefly mentions techniques that require simple or complex substrate preparation.

It should be noted that often, in papers from Dr. Lau’s group, the growth method they use is called lateral aspect ratio trapping (LART) \cite{Han2020, Yan2021}: this is in essence a hybrid between SAG-ART and TASE, and can be described as a type of TASE with particularly wide (sometimes several micrometres) templates, therefore I have grouped it with TASE in the above table. It should be noted, however, that while LART offers most of the same advantages that TASE offers, it is more susceptible to the formation of grain boundaries due to multiple nucleation (which does not take place in TASE) and has reduced defect trapping in the wide direction. On the other hand, due to their etch-based approach, they can achieve more intricate quantum well positioning in their microdisk lasers than what is possible with our TASE approach for microdisk growth.

\section{Article 2}

Due to the presence of the SiO2 template, the quantum wells
develop only axially and not laterally. This results in improved
composition control in heterolayers of ternary III-V
compounds incorporated in the nanowires\cite{Borg2019} and therefore is
expected to allow for better control of the emission spectra.
