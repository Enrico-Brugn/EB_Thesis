\chapter{Literature Review and Methodology}
\label{chap:review}

If the reader asks a common person in the street what "electronics" means they will receive a variety of responses centred on computers, smartphones, television sets, and other everyday appliances. On the other hand, if the same interviewee demographic was asked about "photonics", some might mention \acl{led}s (\acs{led}s) and lasers, others might cite Star Trek or other science-fiction work. The term photonics has not found widespread understanding outside the semiconductor industry, despite these two technologies often being separated by around a decade and a half in the research and development stages. 

The basic building block of modern electronics, the transistor, was invented in 1947 \cite{Bardeen1948, Bardeen1950}. Pointing to a direct equivalent in the history of photonics is not straightforward; however, the first solid-state light-emitting device was described just \num{15} years later in 1962 \cite{Biard1966} and consisted of a \acf{gaas} \acs{led} emitting in the infrared. Interest in solid-state lasing grew immediately after this discovery \cite{Hall1962, Hall1963} affirming the role of III-V semiconductors as solid-state light emitters. The next year, in 1963, Wanlass invented \acf{cmos} technology \cite{Wanlass1967} cementing integrated planar electronics as the main computational platform of the second half of the century. It took four years after this seminal invention for the idea of a \acf{pic} to follow \cite{Miller1969}.

Therefore, while integrated electronics was entering its exponential phase, exemplified by Moore's law \cite{Moore1965}, formulated in the mid-1960s, the building blocks of photonics were just being discovered or still in a conceptual phase. This led to a difference in investment that, in turn, shaped the technological landscape of humanity. While commercial electron-based technologies were progressing through small-, medium- and large-scale integration, up until very large-scale, photon-based technology was mostly commercialised as bulk devices for, until the discovery of the blue \acs{led} in the early 1990s \cite{Nakamura1994}, highly specialised lighting applications, and solid-state lasers. 

The 1990s saw a new revolution: the introduction and rapid diffusion of the Internet. This new technology exposed the limitation of the electron as an information-carrying particle: impedance losses and inductive currents can be sidestepped by choosing to transmit information with pulses of light, as they are issues specific to electron-based technology. Furthermore, fibre optic cables can support a larger data stream compared to copper wires. The switch from metallic cables to optical supports was quickly implemented in the long-range communication infrastructure, going hand in hand with the employment of bulk emitters and absorbers at the two ends of the cable \cite{Schlereth1996}. This change also stimulated interest in the use of this technology in integrated interconnects, which has been growing since the late 1980s \cite{Miller1989}.

The use of photons bypasses some important problems affecting electrical lines in integrated interconnects, such as the "aspect ratio limit" binding the maximum amount of bits per second to the shape of the interconnect \cite{Miller1997}, the dependence of clock timing on temperature, cross-talk between neighbouring interconnects, and the transition between high impedance electronic components and low impedance electronic interconnects, while simultaneously providing voltage isolation and enabling free space interconnects if required \cite{Miller1997_reasons}. Most of these issues also have electrical solutions. Still, these solutions, in turn, increase the energy requirements and therefore the energy loss that occurs on the circuit board. As there is a limit to how much heat can be cost-effectively extracted from each singular chip, photonics becomes attractive from both an energy- and a cost-efficiency point of view \cite{Miller2009}, provided that the integration method allows such an efficiency. 

Indeed, integration is the key step in enabling photonics. The initial photonic circuits of the late 1980s and 1990s were realised directly on \acf{inp} wafers from \num{2} inches to \num{4} inches in diameter. Despite their small size, \acs{inp} wafers are expensive supports compared to the much larger \qty{150}{\milli\metre} and \qty{200}{\milli\metre} \acl{si} supports their contemporary. Still, this spearhead technology managed to achieve very large scale integration density by the mid-2010s, after which it was surpassed by both \acl{si} and III-V on \acl{si} photonic integrated circuits \cite{Shekhar2024, Margalit2021}.

Therefore, an important objective for contemporary scientists working in the field of photonics is to perfect the integration of efficient III-V components on the cheap \acl{si} substrate. The main issue to be addressed in integrating III-V semiconductors on \acl{si} is the mismatch in the lattice parameter between these two materials, which causes a wide variety of defects in monolithic integration \cite{Kunert2018}.

III-V semiconductors are compound semiconductors formed by the stoichiometric combination of elements from the III group (third group, or group thirteen in the modern nomenclature) and the V group (fifth group, or group fifteen) of the periodic table. In their simplest form, they are binary, consisting of one III group and one V group element, with some examples being \acs{inp} and \acs{gaas}. Ternary and quaternary III-V materials such as \ce{In1_-_xGa_xAs} or \ce{In1_-_xGa_xAs1_-_yP_y} contain three or four different elements, respectively. 

Crystallographically, III-V materials are available at room temperature in crystals with the symmetries of space group number \num{216} (F\(\bar{4}\)3m, or zincblende-like) or \num{186} (P6\(_3\)mc, or wurtzite-like) and are easily affected by polytypism when grown. Space group \num{216} is that of a cubic face-centred crystal, while space group \num{186} describes a hexagonal crystal. These two structures are closely related, as the addition of a two-fold axis alongside the three-fold axis of space group \num{216} results in a phase change to space group \num{186}, transforming the affected \hkl<1 1 1> direction in the zincblende phase to the \hkl<0 0 0 1> direction in the wurtzite phase. \hkl{1 1 1} facets can also be described according to which half of the AB stoichiometry of the III-V material is exposed. For example, in Figure~\ref{subfig:GaAs_111} the top layer is entirely composed of V group atoms. This facet is called a \hkl{1 1 1}\(_B\) facet, while a \hkl{1 1 1}\(_A\) facet has III group atoms exposed.

Figure~\ref{fig:ZB_low_index_facets} shows the 2D projections of a \acs{gaas} F\(\bar{4}\)3m crystal along the low-index directions. These projections are useful for interpreting atomic-resolution microscopy images of III-V semiconductors. These computer-generated projections were created using CrystalKit, a dedicated software. They also highlight the main symmetry elements of the zincblende space group. The 2D projection in Figure~\ref{subfig:GaAs_100} shows how a \hkl{0 0 1} facet appears in the microscope. The symmetry element controlling its motif is a four-fold axis perpendicular to the projection plane. Similarly, Figure~\ref{subfig:GaAs_110} shows how a \hkl{1 1 0} facet appears in the microscope and the mirror plane dictating its symmetry. Finally, Figure~\ref{subfig:GaAs_111} shows the lattice projected along the \hkl<1 1 1> direction. The symmetry of this projection is compatible with a three-fold axis coinciding with the \hkl<1 1 1> vector.

The shapes of the polygons that make up the figure also give a hint as to what kind of symmetry element is present in each facet. Figure~\ref{subfig:100_symmetry} can also be used to understand the relationship between different planes in the cubic \acl{si} crystal of the \hkl(0 0 1) \acf{soi} device layer used as growth substrate in Chapter~\ref{chap:growth}.

Figure~\ref{fig:GaAs_rtp} shows a drawing of a \acf{rtp} corresponding to a \hkl{1 1 1} plane in a \acs{gaas} F\(\bar{4}\)3m crystal. Formation of this type of 2D defect is common in the growth of III-V crystals \cite{Borg2017} and its density is very sensitive to changes in the growth environment \cite{Algra2008, Chi2013} due to its low formation energy. From a lattice symmetry point of view, the \acs{rtp} is formed by adding a two-fold rotation axis to the \hkl{1 1 1} direction of the crystal. The two atomic bilayers adjacent to the \acs{rtp} can be considered a thin slice of wurtzite \cite{Glas2007, Vedel2022}.

Both atomic species and lattice symmetry affect the electronic properties of crystals. Bloch functions are the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian that describe a particle in a periodic potential \cite{Dirl2005}, and pose the basis for understanding the behaviour of electrons in crystals. They are also periodic functions, and in reciprocal space they are used to describe the electronic band structure, resulting in plots such as those in Figure~\ref{fig:band_structure}. The band structures in this figure were calculated, using \acf{dft}, and then plotted by Christian Dam Vedel. Energy is on the vertical axis, with its origin at the Fermi energy, which is the energetic midpoint between the last occupied state and the first unoccupied state, at \qty{0}{\kelvin} (thermal zero). The horizontal axis shows wavevectors along certain high-symmetry directions in the unit cell of the reciprocal lattice: the Brillouin zone \cite{Setyawan2010}. The energy of each of the states along the one-dimensional paths that link these points is then plotted. Therefore, in Figure~\ref{fig:band_structure}, the states below the Fermi energy are part of the valence band and those above it are part of the conduction band.

The $\Gamma$ point is the centre of the Brillouin zone and is very important for understanding photon-driven electronic transitions between bands. A material with the minimum of the conduction band and the maximum of the valence band at the $\Gamma$ point is said to have a direct band gap. Conversely, a material that has a band structure with the minimum of the conduction band at a wavevector that is different from the wavevector of the maximum of the valence band is said to have an indirect band gap. Due to momentum conservation rules, a single photon can only cause so-called centrezone transitions, which are transitions between states at the $\Gamma$ point. Interband transitions outside of the centrezone require a third particle, usually a phonon, to mediate the transition, changing the type of interaction from two-particle to three-particle; which has a lower probability of occurring. Similarly, the radiative relaxation pathway is prevalent in direct band-gap semiconductors, while non-radiative relaxation paths are prevalent in indirect band-gap semiconductors.

Therefore, the band gap type greatly affects a semiconductor's light-emitting and -absorbing properties. III-V semiconductors have direct band gaps, as exemplified by those of the zincblende and wurtzite phases of  \acl{inp} shown in Figures~\ref{subfig:ZB_bands_InP} and \ref{subfig:WZ_bands_InP}, and are highly efficient light emitters and absorbers as a consequence. On the contrary, \acl{si} has an indirect bandgap, as shown in Figure~\ref{subfig:Si_bands}, making it an ill-suited material for light emission and absorption.

Tuning a semiconductor's band gap is key to the control of its absorption and emission wavelengths. Although binary III-Vs provide fixed starting points in both band gap and lattice constant, ternary and quaternary III-V compounds allow high-precision tuning of both properties \cite{Ning2017}. For example, the materials chosen by the \acs{design} consortium were \acs{inp} and \ce{In0_.53Ga0_.47As}, because they are lattice-matched and therefore a lower density of defects is expected at their interface \cite{Pearsall1980, Sugii1983, Wagner1970} and because \acs{ingaas} emits in the telecom range \cite{Scherrer2021, Seravalli2020}.

\section{\texorpdfstring{III-V-on-\acs{si} integration routes}{III-V-on-Si integration routes}}
Various III-V synthesis methods are available \cite{Kuech2016}: the following is an overview of epitaxial growth methods focussing on the integration routes of III-V semiconductors on \acl{si}, which can be divided into two broad categories: transfer and monolithic integration.

\subsection{Transfer integration}

Transfer integration refers to the indirect integration of III-V material grown on a different lattice-matched substrate on a \acl{si} wafer. 

The main advantage of these techniques is the absence of lattice mismatch as a source of defects during epitaxial growth. Furthermore, it allows the selection of the best-performing structures to be transferred onto the \acl{si} substrate \cite{Zadeh2016, Wang2017}. Transfer integration does not have to compromise on the growth parameters or material systems to achieve \acs{cmos} compatibility (except for bonding temperature). Together, the various methods that fall under this definition form a mature technology well established in industry \cite{Han2022, Wang2017}, and, as a result, benefit from years of industrial optimisation.

This type of integration requires the growth of III-V in a separate fabrication line that must maintain the high precision and cleanliness standard of the main \acs{cmos} \acl{si} line, resulting in a large capital investment. Furthermore, most classic transfer steps can result in a material with a more irregular geometry (wafer bow, surface roughness after etching), or presenting transfer-related defects \cite{Jevtics2022}, or require an extra bonding layer \cite{Tang2019, Audet1997, Cheng2000, Sparks2001}, and do not allow nanometre precision in integration \cite{McPhillimy2020, Wang2017}. However, the most advanced techniques that bypass most of these quality issues are too slow to provide a competitive transfer time for large, densely integrated \qty{200}{\milli\metre} (or \qty{300}{\milli\metre}) production wafers \cite{McPhillimy2020, Wang2017}.

\subsection{Monolithic integration}

Monolithic integration refers to direct integration by epitaxial growth of III-V semiconductors on a \acl{si} substrate. 

It naturally provides advantages such as extremely high spatial precision and accuracy for small device integration on wafer-scale substrates, which can be achieved in a shorter time frame compared to its transfer analogues \cite{Wang2017, Wei2023}. It has the potential to be a more economical alternative to heterogeneous integration. If the growth process can be integrated with current \acs{cmos} processes, its implementation in a \acs{cmos} line would eliminate the need to have a dedicated III-V fabrication facility running in parallel with a \acl{si}-based plant, especially if the use of III-V electronics is envisioned at the same time as III-V photonics \cite{Wang2017}. Thus, monolithic integration has the potential to reduce the capital cost required to integrate III-V photonics in different \acl{si}-based devices \cite{Wang2017, Tang2019}.

The main disadvantage of monolithic integration is the high lattice mismatch between \acl{si} and most III-V materials \cite{Kuech2016}. The effect of this mismatch in the material is the formation of strain-relaxing defects at the \acl{si} / III-V heterointerface \cite{Kunert2018, Shi2021}: these defects have a very detrimental effect on the performance and lifetime of a device \cite{Mahajan2000, Zenari2021}, and act as scattering or recombination centres \cite{Jeon2015}. The polar nature of III-V atomic bonds compared to nonpolar \acs{si}-\acs{si} bonds means that \acl{apb} (\acs{apb}s) can be created during growth on \acl{si} surfaces with monoatomic steps \cite{Kunert2018}, and most known surface treatments to eliminate nucleation sites for these defects occur in temperature ranges that are incompatible with the \acs{cmos} process \cite{Laracuente2003, Kunert2018, Miller2000}. Furthermore, materials that are known to grow at a higher temperature, such as III – nitrides \cite{Huang2017}, and substances that could have detrimental effects on the passivating of \acf{sio2} layers through their diffusion, such as gallium \cite{Miller2000} which readily diffuses in \acl{sio2} \cite{VanOmmen1987}, also pose temperature-related \acs{cmos} compatibility issues. Another key obstacle, especially related to the direct growth of micro- and nanostructures, is the stricter requirements for the reproducibility and reliability of the process.

There are many monolithic integration routes, and the most common categories are introduced in the following paragraphs.

\paragraph{Planar growth} Direct planar growth of III-Vs on \acl{si} is the simplest method of monolithic integration. It can be suitable for the growth of III-Vs with a lattice constant very close to that of \acl{si} or for the self-assembled nucleation of nanoparticles in a Stranski-Krastanov growth mode, which can pose the basis for quantum dot fabrication \cite{Shi2016, Reithmaier2016}. It, however, presents a few drawbacks related to the absence of a way to contain defects and the different material properties of the material stack \cite{Ravash2012}. It can lead to wafer bow or warp due to the mismatch of thermal coefficients between the various materials \cite{Miyoshi2016, Wang2017_2}, and materials with a high deviation from the \acl{si} lattice parameter can require strain management layers of \qty{1}{\micro\metre} or more to grow without defects \cite{Wang2017_2, Cantoro2012, Huang2022}.
\par
\paragraph{\Acf{sag}} \acs{sag} consists in the growth of III-V material from \acl{si} seeds located in openings in a horizontal mask of a material that does not promote nucleation, such as \acs{sio2}. These holes can be defined with different methods, from self-assembled masking to lithography. This type of growth results in nanostructures \cite{Cantoro2012} such as nanowires, both of a single material and in core-shell configurations with very high position control \cite{Tomioka2011}. Wafer bow and warp are not issues with \acs{sag}, since growth does not, unless promoted by accentuating lateral growth \cite{McKenzie2023}, end up forming a single material layer. However, in this technique, growth develops mainly in the vertical direction, and the presence of lateral growth can result in unwanted heterointerfaces.
\par
\paragraph{Droplet epitaxy} Droplet or \acf{vls} epitaxy consists in guiding the nucleation of III-V material by using a nano-droplet of a catalyst metal on the \acl{si} substrate. This technique also avoids wafer bow as it only results in the growth of nanowires \cite{Wagner1964}. Since \acs{vls} is dependent on the metallic droplet, the growth can be tuned to achieve high directionality and the incorporation of heterostructures with minimal or no unwanted side growth \cite{Harmand2018, Joyce2007}. This type of growth depends on the metal droplets and therefore on their self-assembled distribution on the substrate surface, which diminishes position control \cite{Joyce2007}. Similarly, the geometry of the resulting structures is limited to nanowires \cite{Wagner1964}, and the reservoir effect in the catalyst droplet complicates the control of composition in ternary and quaternary III-V materials \cite{Dubrovskii2017}. Nonetheless, this method allows for sophisticated growth studies such as in-situ TEM imaging \cite{Harmand2018, Maliakkal2020, Jacobsson2016}, leading to the possible refinement of growth recipes to the point where phase control can be achieved \cite{Algra2008, Joyce2007, Caroff2009}.
\par
\paragraph{\Acf{art}} \acs{art} refers to the confinement of defects to the seed region by sidewalls and other such barriers in a growth regimen mediated by a template. The basic idea is that, as most defects nucleate near the \acl{si} / III-V interface and then propagate in directions that are often not parallel to the growth axis, they can be trapped in the region of the material closest to the seed by sidewalls that constrict the III-V crystal so that it grows in a cavity with a high aspect ratio. 

\acs{sag}-\acs{art} has the mask selecting the seed areas increase in thickness to allow the trapping of defects. This technique also allows high position control of the III-V crystal, while accentuating control over the defects \cite{Han2016, Han2016_2}. However, typically \acs{sag}-\acs{art} employs large templates, which means that defects propagating in directions that lie in the plane of the side walls are not filtered by the \acs{art} mechanism \cite{Kunert2018}. Simultaneously, multiple nucleation points in large seed areas can result in grain boundaries that must be eliminated with additional process steps \cite{Kunert2016}.
\par
\paragraph{\Acf{tase}} \acs{tase} can be seen as an evolution of the \acs{sag}-\acs{art} method as it also defines \acl{si} seeds surrounded by \acs{sio2} and uses templates with high aspect ratio to guide the growth. The main difference with \acs{sag}-\acs{art} are the size and complexity of the templates and the focus on planar growth. \acs{tase} enables the growth of various vertical and horizontal nanostructures while maintaining extremely accurate geometry and position control \cite{Ritter2021, Tiwari2020, Schmid2015}. It also enables superior defect control, even compared with \acs{art}: far from the growth interface, defects can be effectively limited to twin planes \cite{Han2020}, which can also be eliminated in some cases \cite{Knoedler2017}. In certain geometries, it also enables phase control \cite{Staudinger2018}. 

On the other hand, it is the most complex method of those listed in terms of overall steps before III-V growth. Furthermore, since nanowires fill templates quickly, \acs{tase} can only grow core-shell structures in a microdisk format \cite{Tiwari2020} and not in nanowire format. Like other techniques which employ a mask to control selectivity, unwanted nucleation on the masks, called parasitic growth, which results in parasitic crystals, can occur \cite{Goswami2021}.
\par

\section{\texorpdfstring{State of \acl{tase}}{State of template assisted selective epitaxy}}

As shown in the previous section, \acs{tase} is one of the most advanced monolithic integration techniques; its implementation can be found in Section~\ref{chap:tase}. The flexibility of \acs{tase} is demonstrated by the different ways research groups have used it. A group at the University of California Santa Barbara used \acs{tase} to achieve high facet control in the homoepitaxial growth of III-V semiconductors \cite{Brunelli2019, Goswami2020, Goswami2021}, while another group at the University of Hong Kong focussed on deposition in large templates \cite{Han2020, Yan2021} to then etch them into the desired device shape \cite{Han2020_2, Huang2024}. Sometimes the name \acf{lart} is used to highlight the use of large templates to create in-plane structures inside templates \cite{Han2020_2}. This method increases the risk of multiple nucleations and limits the defect-trapping effect in the in-plane direction \cite{Han2020, Yan2021, Huang2024}. 

The Hong Kong University and IBM Research Europe Zurich groups have been developing template-based methods to fully integrate planar \acs{pic}s on a \acs{soi} platform \cite{Mauthe2020}. This means a circuit made up of emitters, waveguides, and detectors. With the \acs{tase} method, \acl{si} waveguides can be defined in the same lithography step as emitting and absorbing structures, allowing for high design accuracy \cite{Wen2022}. Emitters can be integrated in the form of microdisks \cite{Tiwari2020, Tiwari2021} or modulators \cite{Scherrer2022, Scherrer2024}. Detectors can be fabricated out of III-V \textit{p}-\textit{i}-\textit{n} structures in nanowires and have demonstrated high performance \cite{Mauthe2020, Wen2022}.

\end{figure}

This project started with the backdrop of the device published by Wen et al. \cite{Wen2022}, shown in its structure in Figure~\ref{fig:wen}. The \acs{bf}-\acs{stem_m} image in Figure~\ref{fig:wen}(A) shows the morphology of the nanowire. A \hkl{1 1 1} \acf{si} facet on the right of the image served as the nucleation surface from which the heterostructures nanowire grew. The selection of this particular facet in \acs{tase} is not casual. The aim is to avoid monoatomic steps on the seed surface that can lead to the formation of \acs{apb}s \cite{Kunert2018}. Nickel-gold contacts are placed at the two \textit{p} and \textit{n} extremities of the doped III-V \textit{p}-\textit{i}-\textit{n} diode. These contact areas were defined specifically for the wire in question. 

Figure~\ref{fig:wen}(B) shows a composition map of the device created from \acf{eds} data. It can be seen that the internal structure of the nanowire contains multi-faceted heterointerfaces. This is exemplified by the first phosphide layer (counting from the \acl{si} seed on the right of the image towards the end of the wire on the left) which presents a bottom \hkl{1 1 1} facet and one visible \hkl{1 1 0} facet at the top, which is indicative of an "arrowhead" morphology implying the presence of a second \hkl{1 1 0} facet at the top \cite{Knoedler2017, Borg2015, Borg2019}. 

The heterointerfaces act as a "snapshot" of the shape of the growth front when the precursors were switched during \acf{mocvd}. The second phosphide layer exemplifies the first issue with a multi-faceted growth front: the layer thickness varies depending on the vertical position in the layer. The second issue is that the contacting of the device is complicated, as it becomes difficult to predict accurately where each layer begins and ends. Even in this situation where the contacts were specifically defined for this device, the contact on the first phosphide layer also touches the arsenide intrinsic layer because of the arrowhead shape of the heterointerface. Further, having facets of different types will result in different growth rates and therefore loss of thickness control for quantum confinement structures such as \acl{qw}s \cite{Han2020}.

The third issue with a multi-faceted growth front is that, in ternary compounds, the integration of each III group element is dependent on the type of facet it is deposited onto \cite{Borg2019}, causing composition gradients within the wire itself with the potential to alter its absorption properties.

Composition gradients at the heterointerfaces are another issue that should be solved before fine structures such as superlattices can be accurately defined. As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:wen}(C) these interface gradients can last hundreds of nanometres, if taken at face value. In reality, the complex geometry of the heterointerfaces also makes it impossible to determine exactly the size of these gradient areas.

Due to these observations, it becomes clear that the quality of devices built with the \acs{tase} process can continue to improve with the reliable integration of quantum wells in nanowires if defined heterointerfaces and constant thickness can be achieved. The potential of this technique for highly controlled quantum well integration in nanowires is given by the absence of side growth and the consequent elimination of core-shell architectures that could emerge in \acs{sag}, allowing for as good or better growth direction control as \acs{vls} techniques.

Stabilisation of a single \hkl{1 1 0} facet has been achieved in homoepitaxy in \acs{sio2} templates, as shown by the integration of quantum wells \cite{Brunelli2019}. Similarly, it has been found that it is possible to select the \hkl{1 1 1}\(_B\) facet as a single growth front by changing the growth conditions, in homoepitaxy \cite{Goswami2020}. Selecting a \hkl{1 1 0} growth front has been the preferred growth method given the high reduction in \acs{rtp} formation in this growth regimen. However, stabilisation of a single \hkl{1 1 0} growth facet from a \hkl{1 1 1} \acl{si} seed surface has been elusive \cite{Knoedler2017}.

As a result, this thesis focusses on stabilising a single \hkl{1 1 1}\(_B\) facet as a growth front from a \hkl{1 1 1} \acl{si} seed surface inside a \acs{tase} template. The possibility of this stabilisation in \acs{tase} has already been shown in the literature \cite{Ritter2021, Borg2015}. However, to my knowledge, no study on this growth regimen's reliability, yield, and possible applications has been published (aside from research that comprises part of this thesis in \cite{Brugnolotto2023, Brugnolotto2023_2}).

\section{Characterisation of nano- and microstructures}

The main difficulty in the characterisation of sub-micrometre structures is their small size. Even techniques instrumental in determining lattice properties, such as X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, struggle at this size. Optical methods are limited in spot size by the diffraction limit and the deviation from the ideal behaviour of optical components. Still, optical techniques such as photoluminescence can provide important information on sub-micrometre structures in the correct conditions, as the right excitation wavelength can, for example, provide information on specific material layers with thicknesses well below the diffraction limit \cite{Scherrer2021}. Laboratory-sized X-ray equipment has a spot size of more than one centimetre. Therefore, crystallographic information cannot be accessed through X-ray methods unless extremely high-cost facility-size tools such as a synchrotron beamline are used. 

\Acf{tem_m} and its scanning version \acf{stem_m} allow atomic-resolution imaging of thin (sub \qty{100}{\nano\metre} in thickness) slices of material. In this thesis, most nanostructure characterisation was carried out using a \acl{stem_i}. Due to the complex interactions between the high-energy (\qty{200}{\kilo\eV} for the tool used in this work) electron beam and matter, a compositional as well as structural information can be extracted from the sample in a single measurement. In a \acs{stem_m} the electron beam spot size determines the resolution of spectrographic methods such as \acf{eds} and \acf{eels}, which can go down to atomic resolution \cite{Bologna2018}. 

The main spectrographic technique used in this thesis is \acs{eds}. The X-ray signal recorded in this technique is generated when, after the electron microscope's beam dislodges a core electron from an atom, an electron from the outer shell falls to fill the vacancy, emitting a photon. This photon can be collected by one (or more) X-ray spectrometers \cite{EBNESAJJAD201439}. Since the cross-sections of each of the possible processes and the energy of the X-rays emitted are known for each element, it becomes possible to calculate relative elemental concentrations and therefore have access to the compositional information of the material \cite{Amari2012}.

The main disadvantages of \acs{stem_m} are that the microscopes required to achieve this level of resolution are very expensive, that sample preparation is destructive, and that the entire sample preparation process is very time-consuming. If and when a correlation between the geometry of the entire micro- or nanostructure and its internal morphology can be established, \acf{sem_m} becomes a faster survey method that can acquire data over chip-sized surfaces in reasonable time frames. Automated \acs{sem_m} data collection combined with computer vision analysis, powered by machine learning, can speed up the yield calculation of nanostructures with critical features smaller than the diffraction limit that cannot be imaged with optical microscopy \cite{Lin2022, Modarres2017, Lee2020}.
