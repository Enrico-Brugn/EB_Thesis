   abstract = {The local integration of III-Vs on Si is relevant for a wide range of applications in electronics and photonics, since it combines a mature and established materials platform with desired physical properties such as a direct and tunenable bandgap and high mobility. The large thermal expansion coefficient and lattice mismatch, however, pose a challenge for the direct growth of III-Vs on Si. In this paper we will review fabrication concepts to overcome this mismatch for the local integration of III-Vs on Si. In particular, we will briefly discuss processing methods based on aspect ratio trapping, nanowire growth, and template-assisted selective epitaxy. The focus of this review will be on the latter, where we will provide an overview of the different possibilities and embodiments of template-assisted selective epitaxy (TASE) and their promise for locally integrated active photonic devices.},

   abstract = {Here we investigate the growth of InAs nanowires on 〈111〉 Si substrates masked by SiO x using metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. We study 〈111〉 (axial) and 〈1-10〉 (radial) growth of InAs NWs by varying growth duration, temperature, group-III molar flows, V/III ratio, mask material, mask opening size, and inter-wire distance. We find that growth takes place without an In droplet and the process evolves through three successive phases: nucleation of an InAs cluster, followed by two distinct nanowire growth phases. These two growth phases have different axial and radial growth rates, which originate in a transition from having In supply dominated by the open Si area in the first phase towards an In supply from the vapor/oxide mask in the second growth phase. The linear relation found between nanowire length and diameter vs. time in the last growth phase indicates that 〈111〉 growth is not surface diffusion limited as is usually the case for catalyzed growth. A high yield of vertical nanowires is obtained if group-III flow is above and V/III ratio below threshold values, in addition to having an arsenic-terminated Si surface. Furthermore, we observe that 〈111〉 and 〈1-10〉 growth is surface kinetically limited below 520 °C and 540 °C, respectively, with activation energies of 20 and 6.5 kcal/mol. This difference in activation energies limits the selectivity of the 〈111〉 to 〈1-10〉 growth to 25:1 under optimized conditions, which must be considered when fabricating axially modulated structures. However, we find that by placing wires in large arrays it is possible to completely stop the 〈1-10〉 growth rate in favor of the 〈111〉 growth rate. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Here we present a monolithic InP on SOI platform to synergize the advantages of two mainstream photonic integration platforms: Si photonics and InP photonics. This monolithic InP/SOI platform is realized through the selective growth of both InP sub-micron wires and large dimension InP membranes on industry-standard (001)-oriented silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers. The epitaxial InP is in-plane, dislocation-free, site-controlled, intimately positioned with the Si device layer, and placed right on top of the buried oxide layer to form “InP-on-insulator”. These attributes allow for the realization of various photonic functionalities using the epitaxial InP, with efficient light interfacing between the III–V devices and the Si-based waveguides. We exemplify the potential of this InP/SOI platform for integrated photonics through the demonstration of lasers with different cavity designs including subwavelength wires, square cavities, and micro-disks. Our results here mark a critical step forward towards fully-integrated Si-based PICs.},

   abstract = {III-V Nanowires (NWs) grown with metal-organic chemical vapor deposition commonly show a polytypic crystal structure, allowing growth of structures not found in the bulk counterpart. In this paper we studied the radial overgrowth of pure wurtzite (WZ) GaAs nanowires and characterized the samples with high resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD) to reveal the crystal structure of the grown material. In particular, we investigated what happens when adjacent WZ NWs radially merge with each other by analyzing the evolution of XRD peaks for different amounts of radial overgrowth and merging. By preparing cross-sectional lamella samples we also analyzed the local crystal structure of partly merged NWs by transmission electron microscopy. Once individual NWs start to merge, the crystal structure of the merged segments is transformed progressively from initial pure WZ to a mixed WZ/ZB structure. The merging process is then modeled using a simple combinatorial approach, which predicts that merging of two or more WZ NWs will result in a mixed crystal structure containing WZ, ZB, and 4H. The existence large and relaxed segments of 4H structure within the merged NWs was confirmed by XRD, allowing us to accurately determine the lattice parameters of GaAs 4H. We compare the measured WZ and 4H unit cells with an ideal tetrahedron and find that both the polytypes are elongated in the c-axis and compressed in the a-axis compared to the geometrically converted cubic ZB unit cell.},

   abstract = {Indium Antimonide (InSb) is a semiconductor material with unique properties, that are suitable for studying new quantum phenomena in hybrid semiconductor-superconductor devices. The realization of such devices with defect-free InSb thin films is challenging, since InSb has a large lattice mismatch with most common insulating substrates. Here, the controlled synthesis of free-standing 2D InSb nanostructures, termed as “nanoflakes”, on a highly mismatched substrate is presented. The nanoflakes originate from the merging of pairs of InSb nanowires grown in V-groove incisions, each from a slanted and opposing \{111\}B facet. The relative orientation of the two nanowires within a pair, governs the nanoflake morphologies, exhibiting three distinct ones related to different grain boundary arrangements: no boundary (type-I), Σ3- (type-II), and Σ9-boundary (type-III). Low-temperature transport measurements indicate that type-III nanoflakes are of a relatively lower quality compared to type-I and type-II, based on field-effect mobility. Moreover, type-III nanoflakes exhibit a conductance dip attributed to an energy barrier pertaining to the Σ9-boundary. Type-I and type-II nanoflakes exhibit promising transport properties, suitable for quantum devices. This platform hosting nanoflakes next to nanowires and nanowire networks can be used to selectively deposit the superconductor by inter-shadowing, yielding InSb-superconductor hybrid devices with minimal post-fabrication steps.},

Temperature (940 K) and total pressure (20 hPa) were selected with this purpose in mind. It is shown that the behaviour of the binaries provides an understanding of the factors determining the deposition of the ternaries and that insights for selective growth on partially masked substrates can be gained from these data. In contrast to lnP and lnAs growth, the rates for the Ga binaries GaAs and GaP and the ternaries depend on the substrate orientation. The variation of the rates of the ternaries is very similar to that of the binary Ga constituents. More importantly, also the composition (Ga content) of the ternaries appears to track with this parameter and varies rather widely, particularly for GalnAs. In the case of selective embedded deposition the differences in rates between the different surfaces tend to be enhanced compared to those on unmasked substrates due to migration effects.},

Such energy dissipation overall is now at environmentally significant levels; the source of that dissipation is progressively shifting from logic operations to interconnect energies. Without the prospect of substantial reduction in energy per bit communicated, we cannot continue the exponential growth of our use of information. The physics of optics and optoelectronics fundamentally addresses both interconnect energy and bandwidth density, and optics may be the only scalable solution to such problems. Here we summarize the corresponding background, status, opportunities, and research directions for optoelectronic technology and novel optics, including subfemtojoule devices in waveguide and novel two-dimensional (2-D) array optical systems. We compare different approaches to low-energy optoelectronic output devices and their scaling, including lasers, modulators and LEDs, optical confinement approaches (such as resonators) to enhance effects, and the benefits of different material choices, including 2-D materials and other quantum-confined structures. With such optoelectronic energy reductions, and the elimination of line charging dissipation by the use optical connections, the next major interconnect dissipations are in the electronic circuits for receiver amplifiers, timing recovery, and multiplexing. We show we can address these through the integration of photodetectors to reduce or eliminate receiver circuit energies, free-space optics to eliminate the need for timing and multiplexing circuits (while also solving bandwidth density problems), and using optics generally to save power by running large synchronous systems. One target concept is interconnects from ∼1 cm to ∼10 m that have the same energy (∼10 fJ/bit) and simplicity as local electrical wires on chip.},

We show a novel hybrid approach in which preselected III−V single quantum dots in nanowires are transferred and integrated in silicon based photonic circuits. The quantum emitters maintain their high optical quality after integration as verified by measuring a low multiphoton probability of 0.07 ± 0.07 and emission line width as narrow as 3.45 ± 0.48 GHz. Our approach allows for optimum alignment of the quantum dot light emission to the fundamental waveguide mode resulting in very high coupling efficiencies. We estimate a coupling efficiency of 24.3 ± 1.7\% from the studied single-photon source to the photonic channel and further show by finite-difference time-domain simulations that for an optimized choice of material and design the efficiency can exceed 90\%. E xperiments on photons have played a key role in our understanding of quantum mechanics by probing the quantized nature of electromagnetic radiation. Since Linear Optical Quantum Computing (LOQC) 1 was proposed, there has been an ongoing effort to achieve a scalable platform for its realization. Few qubit operations have been shown 2,3 and up to eight photon entanglement has been achieved 4 using discrete optical components and parametric down conversion. Although many basic proof of principles have been demonstrated, a more scalable approach is needed for complex architectures. Recently, integrated photonics has gained significant interest as it offers scalability, robustness, and ease of use for on-chip quantum computation. 5−9 A LOQC system comprised of three main components: single photon generation, manipulation, and detection. Single-photons used in integrated photonic circuits are often generated using parametric down conversion or quantum dots (QD). As opposed to parametric down conversion, QDs are suitable for on-demand single photon generation 10 and narrow emission bandwidth, their emission wavelength can be tuned, 11−15 and they offer the possibility of on-chip electrical excitation. 16 As for the logical quantum gates, every discrete unitary operator can be realized using only mirrors and beam splitters. 17 This makes the integrated photonic platform very attractive due to the already available components for passive and active light manipulation. 18 In addition, for single photon detection, >90\% system efficiency has been achieved. 19 However, to realize an efficient LOQC system, it is required to interface all of these often incompatible technologies. Significant efforts have been put into realizing LOQC on-chip. For on-chip detection, efficient coupling of super-conducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPD) with dielectric waveguides has been demonstrated. 20,21 As for the gate operations, complex photonic circuits for quantum operations have been realized. 22,23 In addition, QDs have been coupled to photonic cavities, nanowires, waveguides, 24−26 and SNSPDs. 27 Fabricating low-loss III−V waveguides and selectively embedding single-quantum emitters is a challenge. 28,29 Moreover, growing superconducting films (for detectors) on these substrates often leads to low efficiency or high dark counts. 30 In this work, we present a novel hybrid platform through integration of III−V preselected single QDs embedded in nanowires within robust SiN photonic circuits.

The deterministic selection and integration of single nanowire devices, from large growth populations, is required with high spatial accuracy and yield to enable their integration with on-chip systems. In this review we highlight the main methods by which single nanowires can be transferred from their growth substrate to a target chip. We present a range of chip-scale devices enabled by single NW transfer, including optical sources, receivers and waveguide networks. We discuss the scalability of common integration methods and their compatibility with standard lithographic methods and electronic contacting.},

   abstract = {The heterogeneous integration of micro- and nanoscale devices with on-chip circuits and waveguide platforms is a key enabling technology, with wide-ranging applications in areas including telecommunications, quantum information processing, and sensing. Pick and place integration with absolute positional accuracy at the nanoscale has been previously demonstrated for single proof-of-principle devices. However, to enable scaling of this technology for realization of multielement systems or high throughput manufacturing, the integration process must be compatible with automation while retaining nanoscale accuracy. In this work, an automated transfer printing process is realized by using a simple optical microscope, computer vision, and high accuracy translational stage system. Automatic alignment using a cross-correlation image processing method demonstrates absolute positional accuracy of transfer with an average offset of <40 nm (3σ < 390 nm) for serial device integration of both thin film silicon membranes and single nanowire devices. Parallel transfer of devices across a 2 × 2 mm2 area is demonstrated with an average offset of <30 nm (3σ < 705 nm). Rotational accuracy better than 45 mrad is achieved for all device variants. Devices can be selected and placed with high accuracy on a target substrate, both from lithographically defined positions on their native substrate or from a randomly distributed population. These demonstrations pave the way for future scalable manufacturing of heterogeneously integrated chip systems.},

The study is based on an extensive deep-level transient spectroscopy investigation, carried out on GaAs pin diodes grown on Si and on GaAs (that differ in the dislocation density), with and without embedded QDs. The original results described in this paper demonstrate that: (a) we were able to identify four different defects within the device grown on Si (three electron and one hole traps) and one defect (hole trap) in the device on GaAs, common to both samples; (b) all the majority carrier traps identified are located near midgap, i.e. are efficient non-radiative recombination centers; (c) such defects are absent (or non-detectable) in the sample grown on GaAs substrate, having a very low dislocation density; (d) the presence of QDs does not result in additional defects within the semiconductor material; (e) the analysis of the capture kinetics revealed that two of the identified traps are related to point defects, whereas the other two traps can be associated with point defects located near a dislocation; (f) a comparison with previous reports indicate that the detected traps are related to native III-As defects, or to oxygen-related complexes.},

   abstract = {In the present talk we discuss the application of Template-Assisted Selective Epitaxy (TASE) for the monolithic integration of III-V active photonic devices on silicon. The main concept of TASE relies on the guided growth of III-Vs within a confined oxide template. At one extremity of the template there is access to silicon to start the nucleation, and subsequently it is the template which guides the growth progression. This decoupling of the resulting geometry from the growth mode and substrate orientation, results in a larger processing window as we no longer rely on the growth conditions to tune the geometry, as well as a number of other advantages. A further unique advantage of TASE for silicon photonics applications is that it allows for the truly local integration of III-V material at precisely defined positions, since the location of the III-V may be defined with nm-scale precision in the same lithographic step as silicon passives. TASE was originally developed for electronics, but in recent years we have expanded it to enable several photonic devices. In the present talk, I will discuss our work on GaAs and InP microdisk lasers fabricated by either direct growth or via the use of micro-substrates. These devices show lasing at room temperature around 870 nm with thresholds of about 10 pJ/pulse. We also explore the use of metal-clad cavities for further light confinement.},

   abstract = {Metastable wurtzite crystal phases of conventional semiconductors comprise enormous potential for high-performance electro-optical devices, owed to their extended tunable direct band gap range. However, synthesizing these materials in good quality and beyond nanowire size constraints has remained elusive. In this work, the epitaxy of wurtzite InP microdisks and related geometries on insulator for advanced optical applications is explored. This is achieved by an elaborate combination of selective area growth of fins and a zipper-induced epitaxial lateral overgrowth, which enables co-integration of diversely shaped crystals at precise position. The grown material possesses high phase purity and excellent optical quality characterized by STEM and µ-PL. Optically pumped lasing at room temperature is achieved in microdisks with a lasing threshold of 365 µJ cm-2. Our platform could provide novel geometries for photonic applications.},

   abstract = {The selective area growth technique, confined epitaxial lateral overgrowth (CELO), enables the growth of lateral III-V heterojunctions integrated on mismatched substrates. In CELO, effective control of facet shapes, as well as defect-free growths are essential to fabricating high-quality nanostructures with custom geometries. Here, the effects of growth temperature, V/III ratio, template alignments, and substrate orientations on the observed facets and defect densities in CELO grown InP and related materials on InP substrates are investigated. The nanostructure facets and defects are determined using a combination of plan-view and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy. For homoepitaxial CELO growth on InP (100) substrates, growth temperatures below 575∘C, and high V/III ratios of 450 aid in increasing the surface areas of the \{111\}B facets, while reducing defect densities. Further, by changing template alignments, the effective areas of overgrowth can be tuned, and defects can be lowered, with templates aligned along [01¯0] yielding the largest defect-free areas. By aligning templates in the [1¯10] orientation on a (110) InP substrate, near defect-free overgrowth with perfectly flat perpendicular single (11¯ 0) facets can be achieved. This is an essential feature to enable the growth of lateral III-V heterojunctions, as is demonstrated by growing InP/InGaAs CELO heterojunctions with \{110\} facets.},

   abstract = {InGaAs is a potential candidate for Si replacement in upcoming advanced technological nodes because of its excellent electron transport properties and relatively low interface defect density in dielectric gate stacks. Therefore, integrating InGaAs devices with the established Si platforms is highly important. Using template-assisted selective epitaxy (TASE), InGaAs nanowires can be monolithically integrated with high crystal quality, although the mechanisms of group III incorporation in this ternary material have not been thoroughly investigated. Here we present a detailed study of the compositional variations of InGaAs nanostructures epitaxially grown on Si(111) and Silicon-on-insulator substrates by TASE. We present a combination of XRD data and detailed EELS maps and find that the final Ga/In chemical composition depends strongly on both growth parameters and the growth facet type, leading to complex compositional sub-structures throughout the crystals. We can further conclude that the composition is governed by the facet-dependent chemical reaction rates at low temperature and low V/III ratio, while at higher temperature and V/III ratio, the incorporation is transport limited. In this case we see indications that the transport is a competition between Knudsen flow and surface diffusion.},

   abstract = {Selective area epitaxy is a powerful growth technique that has been used to produce III–V semiconductor nanowire and nanomembrane arrays for photonic and electronic applications. The incorporation of a heterostructure such as quantum wells (QWs) brings new functionality and further broadens their applications. Using InP nanowires and nanomembranes as templates, we investigate the growth of InAsP QWs on these pure wurtzite nanostructures. InAsP QWs grow both axially and laterally on the nanowires and nanomembranes, forming a zinc blende phase axially and wurtzite phase on the sidewalls. On the non-polar \{100\} sidewalls, the radial QW selectively grows on one sidewall which is located at the semi-polar 〈11〉 A side of the axial QW, causing the shape evolution of the nanowires from hexagonal to triangular cross section. For nanomembranes with \{100\} sidewalls, the radial QW grows asymmetrically on the \{100\} facet, destroying their symmetry. In comparison, nanomembranes with \{110\} sidewalls are shown to be an ideal template for the growth of InAsP QWs, thanks to the uniform QW formation. These QWs emit strongly in the near IR region at room temperature and their emission can be tuned by changing their thickness or composition. These findings enrich our understanding of the QW growth, which provides new insights for heterostructure design in other III–V nanostructures.},

TMAH solutions containing butanol-2 and ternary solutions composed of TMAH + Triton + alcohol, used in the experiments, had not been investigated before. The phenomena associated with the presence of surfactant and alcohol additives in etching solutions were analyzed and the mechanism including co-solving of surfactant molecules in alcohol and interplay in the adsorbing mechanism was proposed. The influence of these phenomena on the etching rates and morphologies of Si(1 0 0) and Si(1 1 0) was discussed. The addition of alcohol, especially butanol-2, to a TMAH solution resulted in significant improvement of the etched surface finish. The roughness of Si(1 1 0) surfaces etched in TMAH + butanol solutions was superior to the roughness of the surfaces etched in TMAH + Triton. The best surface roughness parameters of Si(1 1 0) (Ra = 0.0322 μm and RMS = 0.0549 μm), measured with an optical profilometer on the area of 1.6 mm × 1.6 mm, were achieved after etching in a ternary solution of TMAH + Triton + butanol.

   abstract = {InP/InGaAs and InGaAs/InP interfaces in heterostructures grown by metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE) have been studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cross-sectional TEM 002 dark field images of the direct (InP-InGaAs) and inverted (InGaAs-InP) interfaces revealed a great difference in abruptness. Whereas the direct interface is always well defined and flat, the inverted one is compositionally graded and shows surface undulations. InP-InGaAs heterostructures were studied for different layer thicknesses and phosphine flow rates. The results indicate that this effect originates more from the substitution of arsenic by phosphorus atoms in subsurface InGaAs monolayers rather than from As carryover to the InP layer. The strong As-P exchange observed over several InGaAs monolayers is related to the large difference in chemical bond strength between Ga-As and Ga-P. This is supported by comparison with InP/InAlAs/InP and InP/In 1-xGa xAs yP 1-y/InP (0.1<x<0.4) heterostructures. The inverted InAlAs/InP interface is much more abrupt than the InGaAs/InP one and does not show any surface undulations. Furthermore, the In 1-xGa xAs yP 1-y/InP interface surface undulations increase with x composition. These results, valid for our experimental configuration, indicate that MOVPE grown InGaAs/InP interfaces can be improved by using very low hydride flow during the switching sequence. © 2002 American Institute of Physics. © 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

It is found that the effective V/III ratio is reduced at least by a factor of two within the nanotube templates compared to the outside, detectable by changes in the growth facet morphology. The reduced V/III ratio originates from the different transport mechanisms for the As and In precursor species; As and In species are both transported by Knudsen diffusion in the vapor, but an additional contribution of In surface diffusion reduces the V/III ratio. The results reveal the interplay of growth parameters, crystal facets and template geometry and thus are generally applicable for nanoscale selective epitaxy.},

A high degree of morphological control allows for GaSb nanostructures with critical dimensions down to 20 nm. Detailed investigation of growth parameters reveals that the GaSb growth rate is governed by the desorption processes of an Sb surface layer and, in turn, is insensitive to changes in material transport efficiency. The GaSb crystal structure is typically zinc-blende with a low density of rotational twin defects, and even occasional twin-free structures are observed. Hall/van der Pauw measurements are conducted on 20 nm-thick GaSb nanostructures, revealing high hole mobility of 760 cm2/(V s), which matches literature values for high-quality bulk GaSb crystals.

We chart the generational trends in silicon photonics technology, drawing parallels from the generational definitions of CMOS technology. We identify the crucial challenges that must be solved to make giant strides in CMOS-foundry-compatible devices, circuits, integration, and packaging. We identify challenges critical to the next generation of systems and applications—in communication, signal processing, and sensing.

With fine-tuned SCL thickness and lattice constant, the optical performance of the five-stack QDs was enhanced. The improvements can be attributed to the smooth growth front, observed from the AFM images, and the well-balanced stress engineering.},

Initial results towards this new approach will be presented, such as on optically active GaAs/InAs core-shell quantum dots directly grown on Si and on monolithic integration of InAs nanoclusters fully embedded into a defect free and planar Si matrix. Due to the minimization of the consumption of the involved III-V materials and the complete Si coverage, standard Si processes on a full wafer scale are feasible.},

   abstract = {We built a calculation model for the wafer bow in GaN-on-Si epiwafers employing GaN/AlN multilayer (ML) buffer structures by extending Stoney's equation. The calculated bow and the derived strain in the epilayers were almost consistent with experimental results. The calculation quantitatively revealed that the ML buffers introduced an in-plane compressive stress in the epitaxial structures. Also, relationships between the epiwafer bow and the stress in the respective layers became clear to a certain extent. For instance, when considering the case where periodic structures with 20 nm thick GaN/5 nm thick AlN pairs were grown as ML buffers on 4-in.-diameter and 525 μm thick Si (111) substrates at a growth temperature (T g) of 1125 °C, the stress in the MLs was derived to be 2.18 GPa in the in-plane compressive direction in the GaN layers and 5.89 GPa in the in-plane tensile direction in the AlN layers at T g. Although magnitude of the in-plane stress in the GaN layers is obviously smaller than that in the AlN layers, the restoring force generated in the GaN layers becomes larger than that in the AlN layers, because the force is in proportion to the layer thickness rather than to just the stress. As a consequence, the generated stress in the MLs was considered to produce enough force to suppress the epiwafer bow. The calculation also demonstrated that GaN epilayers on GaN/AlN MLs were strained in the in-plane compressive direction at T g and almost strain-free at room temperature.},

   abstract = {When epitaxially growing III-V compound semiconductors on Si substrates the mismatch of coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) between III-V and Si causes stress and wafer bow. The wafer bow is deleterious for some wafer-scale processing especially when the wafer size is large. Strain engineering was applied in the epitaxy of InGaP films on 200 mm silicon wafers having high quality germanium buffers. By applying compressive strain in the InGaP films to compensate the tensile strain induced by CTE mismatch, wafer bow was decreased from about 100 μm to less than 50 μm. X-ray diffraction studies show a clear trend between the decrease of wafer bow and the compensation of CTE mismatch induced tensile strain in the InGaP layers. In addition, the anisotropic strain relaxation in InGaP films resulted in anisotropic wafer bow along two perpendicular (110) directions. Etch pit density and plane-view transmission electron microscopy characterizations indicate that threading dislocation densities did not change significantly due to the lattice-mismatch applied in the InGaP films. This study shows that strain engineering is an effective method to control wafer bow when growing III-V semiconductors on large size Si substrates.},

Our studies reveal a significant reduction of basal plane stacking faults (BSFs) in semi-polar GaN grown on planar Si(112) by applying a low temperature (LT) AlN interlayer. We find that the insertion of the LT-AlN interlayer can eliminate the stacking faults in the upper GaN layer, when the LT-AlN interlayer is inserted on a smooth GaN buffer. The LT-AlN interlayer results in lattice relaxation due to misfit dislocation formation at the GaN/LT-AlN interface.

   abstract = {In this work, we present a method to synthesize arrays of hexagonal InGaN submicrometer platelets with a top c-plane area having an extension of a few hundred nanometers by selective area metal−organic vapor-phase epitaxy. The InGaN platelets were made by in situ annealing of InGaN pyramids, whereby InGaN from the pyramid apex was thermally etched away, leaving a c-plane surface, while the inclined \{101̅ 1\} planes of the pyramids were intact. The as-formed c-planes, which are rough with islands of a few tens of nanometers, can be flattened with InGaN regrowth, showing single bilayer steps and high-quality optical properties (full width at half-maximum of photoluminescence at room temperature: 107 meV for In 0.09 Ga 0.91 N and 151 meV for In 0.18 Ga 0.82 N). Such platelets offer surfaces having relaxed lattice constants, thus enabling shifting the quantum well emission from blue (as when grown on GaN) to green and red. For single InGaN quantum wells grown on the c-plane of such InGaN platelets, a sharp interface between the quantum well and the barriers was observed. The emission energy from the quantum well, grown under the same conditions, was shifted from 2.17 eV on In 0.09 Ga 0.91 N platelets to 1.95 eV on In 0.18 Ga 0.82 N platelets as a result of a thicker quantum well and a reduced indium pulling effect on In 0.18 Ga 0.82 N platelets. On the basis of this method, prototype light-emitting diodes were demonstrated with green emission on In 0.09 Ga 0.91 N platelets and red emission on In 0.18 Ga 0.82 N platelets.},

   abstract = {Control of the crystallization process is central to developing nanomaterials with atomic precision to meet the demands of electronic and quantum technology applications. Semiconductor nanowires grown by the vapor−liquid−solid process are a promising material system in which the ability to form components with structure and composition not achievable in bulk is well-established. Here, we use in situ TEM imaging of Au-catalyzed GaAs nanowire growth to understand the processes by which the growth dynamics are connected to the experimental parameters. We find that two sequential steps in the crystallization processnucleation and layer growthcan occur on similar time scales and can be controlled independently using different growth parameters. Importantly, the layer growth process contributes significantly to the growth time for all conditions and will play a major role in determining material properties such as compositional uniformity, dopant density, and impurity incorporation. The results are understood through theoretical simulations correlating the growth dynamics, liquid droplet, and experimental parameters. The key insights discussed here are not restricted to Au-catalyzed GaAs nanowire growth but can be extended to most compound nanowire growths in which the different growth species has very different solubility in the catalyst particle. A central challenge in crystal growth is to understand the dynamic and transient processes underlying the nucleation and growth steps. The ability to independently control these two steps would greatly expand the potential to design the structure, morphology, and properties of the resulting material. Understanding the steps in crystallization is particularly important in the emerging fields of nanoscale and confined crystal growth, where a large interface-to-volume ratio enables new degrees of freedom in designing crystal properties. 1,2 Vapor−liquid−solid (VLS) growth of nanowires, which uses a nanoscale liquid melt to control nucleation and crystal growth, is a promising and versatile growth technique. 3−5 For semiconductor materials, the VLS growth process enables synthesis of metastable crystal phases, 4−9 metastable semiconductor alloys, 5,10,11 extremely high dopant and impurity incorporation, 12−14 and atomically precise lattice-mis-matched 15−17 and crystal-phase heterostructures. 18−20 Understanding the nucleation and crystallization processes at the interface in VLS-growth, and how these are influenced by the finite size of the liquid droplet, is centrally important for controlled design of these nanomaterials. In particular, it is critical to understand on an atomic scale the mechanisms by which the growth process is correlated to accessible experimental parameters. The VLS process is understood to occur by dissolution of semiconductor precursor species (or their derivatives) in a liquid metal (often Au-based), followed by precipitation of the solid semiconductor after the liquid becomes supersatu-rated. 21,22 This process occurs in two steps: formation of a critical nucleus at the liquid−solid interface followed by layer growth across this interface. 23,24 Since the metal droplet is relatively small, the number of atoms causing supersaturation of the liquid is finite and could be consumed during the formation of a layer. 25 After the growth of a complete layer following the nucleation, there typically is an "incubation" (waiting) period before the nucleation of the next layer. 26−28 Most theoretical models on nanowire growth have assumed the layer completion time to be negligible compared to incubation time. 26,29−31 In},

Catalytically grown nanowires are ideal systems for studying the fundamental physics of phase selection, and could lead to new electronic applications based on the engineering of crystal phases. Here we image gallium arsenide (GaAs) nanowires during growth as they switch between phases as a result of varying growth conditions. We find clear differences between the growth dynamics of the phases, including differences in interface morphology, step flow and catalyst geometry. We explain these differences, and the phase selection, using a model that relates the catalyst volume, the contact angle at the trijunction (the point at which solid, liquid and vapour meet) and the nucleation site of each new layer of GaAs. This model allows us to predict the conditions under which each phase should be observed, and use these predictions to design GaAs heterostructures. These results could apply to phase selection in other nanowire systems.},

   abstract = {Crystal growth often proceeds by atomic step flow. When the surface area available for growth is limited, the nucleation and progression of the steps can be affected. This issue is particularly relevant to the formation of nanocrystals. We examine the case of Au-catalyzed GaAs nanowires, which we grow in a transmission electron microscope. Our in situ observations show that atomic layers nucleate at the periphery of the interface between the nanowire and the catalyst droplet. From this starting location, the atomic step flows within a restricted area of hexagonal shape. At specific partial coverages, the monolayer configuration changes abruptly. A simple model based on the geometry of the system and its edge energies explains these observations. In particular, we observe an inversion of the step curvature which reveals that the effective energy per unit length of monolayer edge is much lower at the interface periphery than inside the catalyst droplet. Harnessing the potential of nanocrystals for a wide range of applications requires an ever-improved control of their properties. A remarkable specificity of nanocrystals is the strong influence of their surfaces and edges on their properties. The important role of crystal boundaries also manifests itself at the growth stage. Indeed, surfaces influence the morphology and crystalline arrangement of nanostructures, not only as regards thermodynamics but also via their growth dynamics. This is notably illustrated in the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth [1] of semiconductor nanowires (NWs). In this method, vapor containing the NW constituents is supplied to a liquid catalyst nanoparticle. Upon supersaturation of the catalyst droplet, crystallization occurs: A nanocrystal forms, one of its facets in contact with the droplet. This nanofacet is where crystal growth further proceeds. A detailed and real-time observation of the liquid-solid interface is thus expected to clarify the role of the boundaries in the crystallization process. Pioneering studies based on in situ NW growth in a transmission electron microscope (TEM) have already reported such observations. It was clearly shown that the atomic layers form sequentially at the catalyst-NW interface [2-5]. In some cases, the propagation along the interface of the atomic step bordering the layer could even be seen [3,5]. In planar growth of macroscopic crystals from a vapor, the step flow regime has been studied for several decades [6-8]. This growth mode results from the preferential attachment of atoms to the steps present on a crystalline surface. When adatom diffusion is sufficient, this regime prevails over the formation of new nuclei onto flat terraces. In the NW case, the area where growth takes place is so small that it is traversed by single steps which flow one by one. However, the precise geometry and dynamics of this interfacial step flow remain to be explored. In the present work, we demonstrate that the NW boundaries have a direct impact on the geometry of the step motion. This allows us to evaluate the capillary forces acting on the growing system. Together with the location of the first observable islands, these results provide robust and quantitative arguments to explain the formation of a metastable crystalline phase. Indeed, compound semiconductor NWs grow mostly along the h111i or h0001i directions [2-5], these indexings referring to the zinc blende (ZB) or wurtzite (WZ) structures that the NW can adopt [9]. The conditions determining which of these two phases forms have been much discussed [5,10-12], but experimental support is still necessary to clarify this question. For many III-V compounds , the stable bulk crystal phase is ZB. In 2007, we proposed that the crystalline stacking of each monolayer (ML) [13] is determined at its nucleation stage and that WZ stacking is related to nucleation at the triple phase line (TPL), the boundary between NW, catalyst, and vapor: With this anchor to the TPL, the total edge energy of the ML nucleus can be lower in WZ position than in ZB position [11]. Hence, identification of the exact nucleation site is key to understanding the mechanisms of phase selection in NW growth. To date, full experimental evidence of MLs forming at the TPL is lacking. Some TEM observations of in situ NW growth suggest that it is the case [2,5]. Nevertheless, the observation conditions adopted in these studies, with the},

   abstract = {Semiconducting nanowires offer the possibility of nearly unlimited complex bottom-up design, which allows for new device concepts. However, essential parameters that determine the electronic quality of the wires, and which have not been controlled yet for the III-V compound semiconductors, are the wire crystal structure and the stacking fault density. In addition, a significant feature would be to have a constant spacing between rotational twins in the wires such that a twinning superlattice is formed, as this is predicted to induce a direct bandgap in normally indirect bandgap semiconductors, such as silicon and gallium phosphide. Optically active versions of these technologically relevant semiconductors could have a significant impact on the electronics and optics industry. Here we show first that we can control the crystal structure of indium phosphide (InP) nanowires by using impurity dopants. We have found that zinc decreases the activation barrier for two-dimensional nucleation growth of zinc-blende InP and therefore promotes crystallization of the InP nanowires in the zinc-blende, instead of the commonly found wurtzite, crystal structure. More importantly, we then demonstrate that we can, once we have enforced the zinc-blende crystal structure, induce twinning superlattices with long-range order in InP nanowires. We can tune the spacing of the superlattices by changing the wire diameter and the zinc concentration, and we present a model based on the distortion of the catalyst droplet in response to the evolution of the cross-sectional shape of the nanowires to quantitatively explain the formation of the periodic twinning. ©2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Such applications require a high degree of nanowire growth control, right down to the atomic level. However, many binary semiconductor nanowires exhibit a high density of randomly distributed twin defects and stacking faults, which results in an uncontrolled, or polytypic, crystal structure. Here, we demonstrate full control of the crystal structure of InAs nanowires by varying nanowire diameter and growth temperature. By selectively tuning the crystal structure, we fabricate highly reproducible polytypic and twin-plane superlattices within single nanowires. In addition to reducing defect densities, this level of control could lead to bandgap engineering and novel electronic behaviour. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

This is achieved by a two-temperature growth procedure, consisting of a brief initial high-temperature growth step followed by prolonged growth at a lower temperature. The initial high-temperature step is essential for obtaining straight, vertically aligned epitaxial nanowires on the (111)B GaAs substrate. The lower temperature employed for subsequent growth imparts superior nanowire morphology and crystallographic quality by minimizing radial growth and eliminating twinning defects. Photoluminescence measurements confirm the excellent optical quality of these two-temperature grown nanowires.

   abstract = {Based on the recent achievements in vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) synthesis, characterization and modeling of ternary III-V nanowires and axial heterostructures within such nanowires, we try to understand the major trends in their compositional evolution from a general theoretical perspective. Clearly, the VLS growth of ternary materials is much more complex than in standard vapor-solid epitaxy techniques, and even maintaining the necessary control over the composition of steady-state ternary nanowires is far from straightforward. On the other hand, VLS nanowires offer otherwise unattainable material combinations without introducing structural defects and hence are very promising for next-generation optoelectronic devices, in particular those integrated with a silicon electronic platform. In this review, we consider two main problems. First, we show how and by means of which parameters the steady-state composition of Au-catalyzed or self-catalyzed ternary III-V nanowires can be tuned to a desired value and why it is generally different from the vapor composition. Second, we present some experimental data and modeling results for the interfacial abruptness across axial nanowire heterostructures, both in Au-catalyzed and self-catalyzed VLS growth methods. Refined modeling allows us to formulate some general growth recipes for suppressing the unwanted reservoir effect in the droplet and sharpening the nanowire heterojunctions. We consider and refine two approaches developed to date, namely the regular crystallization model for a liquid alloy with a critical size of only one III-V pair at high supersaturations or classical binary nucleation theory with a macroscopic critical nucleus at modest supersaturations.},

As the field of silicon photonics becomes more mature, foundry processes will be an essential piece of the ecosystem for eliminating process risk and allowing the community to focus on adding value through clever design. Multi-project wafer runs are a useful tool to promote further development by providing inexpensive, low-risk prototyping opportunities to academic and commercial researchers. Compared to dedicated silicon manufacturing runs, multi-project-wafer runs offer cost reductions of 100× or more. Through OpSIS, we have begun to offer validated device libraries that allow designers to focus on building systems rather than modifying device geometries. The EDA tools that will enable rapid design of such complex systems are under intense development. Progress is also being made in developing practical optical and electronic packaging solutions for the photonic chips, in ways that eliminate or sharply reduce development costs for the user community.

However, silicon photonics bucked the trend, with industry observers estimating the commercial market to close in on a billion dollars in 2020. Silicon photonics leverages the billions of dollars and decades of research poured into silicon semiconductor device processing to enable high yield, robust processing, and most of all, low cost. Silicon is also a good optical material, with transparency in the commercially important infrared wavelength bands, and is a suitable platform for large-scale photonic integrated circuits. Silicon photonics is therefore slated to address the world's ever-increasing needs for bandwidth. It is part of an emerging ecosystem which includes designers, foundries, and integrators. In this paper, we review most of the foundries that presently enable silicon photonics integrated circuits fabrication. Some of these are pilot lines of major research institutes, and others are fully commercial pure-play foundries. Since silicon photonics has been commercially active for some years, foundries have released process design kits (PDK) that contain a standard device library. These libraries represent optimized and well-tested photonic elements, whose performance reflects the stability and maturity of the integration platforms. We will document the early works in silicon photonics, as well as its commercial status. We will provide a comprehensive review of the development of silicon photonics and the foundry services which enable the productization, including various efforts to develop and release PDK devices.

For this purpose tuning properties of DFB lasers are very important. Typical thermal tuning and current tuning schemes will be discussed. However, single mode lasers are only available for very few specific wavelengths which generally do not coincide with the absorption lines of interesting gaseous species. A few nm tuning range can be achieved changing operation temperature. Larger wavelength ranges can be achieved with tunable lasers currently under development for future telecommunication systems. Widely tunable single mode lasers appear a very promising light source for tunable diode laser spectroscopy.},

   abstract = {It is shown that a purely local-pseudopotential calculation is able to accurately reproduce the major optical gaps and cyclotron masses. However, deviations from the experimental results become manifest in photoemission and x-ray charge-density results as we extend our calculations to the lower valence bands. These deviations indicate the necessity of an energy-dependent nonlocal swell potential, a conclusion which is also supported by an analysis of the Heine-Abarenkov pseudopotential scheme. A detailed comparison is made between experimental results obtained from optical, photoemission, x-ray, and cyclotron-resonance measurements, and the results of both the local calculation and an energy-dependent nonlocal calculation. Yang and Coppens's recent determination of the valence charge density in silicon makes it possible to assess the accuracy of the pseudocharge densities for the first time.},

As optical technology improves and link frequencies continue to increase, optical links will be increasingly considered for shorter, higher-bandwidth links such as I/O, memory, and system bus links. For these links closer to processors, issues such as packaging, power dissipation, and components cost assume increasing importance along with link bandwidth and link distance. Also, as optical links move steadily closer to the processors, we may see significant differences in how servers, particularly high-end servers, are designed and packaged to exploit the unique characteristics of optical interconnects. This paper reviews the various levels of a server interconnect hierarchy and the current status of optical interconnect technology for these different levels. The potential impacts of optical interconnect technology on future server designs are also reviewed.},

To fulfill the need of high-performance photodetectors (PDs) monolithically integrated on Si for Si photonics, we demonstrate III-V PDs directly grown on a InP/Si-on-insulator (SOI) platform parallel to the Si device layer in a variety of device dimensions. Device characteristics including a 3 dB bandwidth beyond 40 GHz, open eye diagrams at 40 Gb/s, a dark current of 0.55 nA, a responsivity of 0.3 A/W at 1550 nm, and 0.8 A/W at 1310 nm together with a 410 nm operation wavelength span from 1240 nm to 1650 nm are achieved. We further simulate the feasibility of interfacing the III-V PDs with the Si waveguide by designing waveguide-coupled PDs with butt coupling schemes. These results point to a practical solution for the monolithic integration of III-V active components and Si-based passive devices on a InP/SOI platform in the future.},

The integration of on-chip light sources, especially single-mode lasers, is crucial for advancing those photonic chips to their full potential. Recently, novel concepts involving topological designs introduced a variety of options for tuning device properties such as the desired single mode emission. Here we introduce a novel cavity design that allows to amplify the topological interface mode by deterministic placement of gain material within the topological lattice. The proposed design is experimentally implemented by a selective epitaxy process resulting in Si and InGaAs nanorods embedded within the same topological lattice. This results in the first demonstration of a single-mode laser in the telecom band using the concept of amplified topological modes.},

Far field and near field radiation patterns show that the light emission from GaAs and GaAszPl_z lasers comes from a thin sheet, less than a few microns in thickness, which includes the junction itself. The distribution of light intensity along the junction edge is often quite non-uniform and can account for the structure which is observed in the far field patterns. The threshold current density is calculated on the assumption that the radiative transition involves free electrons and holes. From this and other evidence, it is concluded that in heavily doped laser junctions the transitions take place between states which closely resemble the conduction and valence band states of the pure semiconductor.},

This limit is largely independent of the details of the design of the electrical lines. The limit is approximately B ~ B o A/" 2 bits/s, with B o ~ 10 15 (bit/s) for high-performance strip lines and cables, ~10 16 for small on-chip lines, and ~10 17-10 18 for equalized lines. Because the limit is scale-invariant, neither growing or shrinking the size of the system substantially changes the limit. Exceeding this limit requires techniques such as repeatering, coding, and multilevel modulation. Such a limit will become a problem as machines approach Tb/s information bandwidths. The limit will particularly affect architectures in which one processor must talk reasonably directly with many others. We argue that optical interconnects can solve this problem since they avoid the resistive loss physics that gives this limit.},

Specifically we study interfaces between the ground state Zincblende crystal structure and the meta-stable Wurtzite phase, with an emphasis on the rotational twin plane defect, which forms due to the polytypic nature of InP. We found that the transition of the band structure across the interface is anisotropic and lasts 7 nm (3.5 nm). Due to this, a crystal-phase quantum well would require a minimal width of 10 nm, which eliminates rotational twin planes as possible quantum wells. We also found that for conducting current, the interfaces increase conductivity along the defect-plane ([11   $$\bar\{2\}$$    2   ¯      ]), whereas due to real growth limitations, despite the interfaces reducing conductivity across the defect-plane ([111]), we found that a high degree of polytypic defects are still desirable.

In contrast to GaAs nanowires grown by (SAG) in which rotational twins and stacking faults are almost universally observed, twin formation is either suppressed or eliminated within properly oriented nanosheets are grown under a range of growth conditions. A morphology transition in the nanosheets due to twinning results in surface energy reduction, which may also explain the high twin-defect density that occurs within some III-V semiconductor nanostructures, such as GaAs nanowires. Calculations suggest that the surface energy is significantly reduced by the formation of \{111\}-plane bounded tetrahedra after the morphology transition of nanowire structures. By contrast, owing to the formation of two vertical \{11̄0\} planes which comprise the majority of the total surface energy of nanosheet structures, the energy reduction effect due to the morphology transition is not as dramatic as that for nanowire structures. Furthermore, the surface energy reduction effect is mitigated in longer nanosheets which, in turn, suppresses twinning.},

Here we present low-temperature integration of InAs on W using Si3N4 template assisted selective area metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE). Despite growth nucleation on polycrystalline W, we can obtain a high yield of single-crystalline InAs nanowires, as observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The nanowires exhibit a mobility of 690 cm2/(V s), a low-resistive, Ohmic electrical contact to the W film, and a resistivity which increases with diameter attributed to increased grain boundary scattering.

These materials include traditional II-VI and III-V semiconductors and their alloys, inorganic and hybrid perovskites, and the newly emerging 2D materials. One important common feature of these materials is that their nanoscale dimensions result in a large tolerance to lattice mismatches within a monolithic structure of varying composition or between the substrate and target material, which enables us to achieve almost arbitrary control of the variation of the alloy composition. As a result, the bandgaps of these alloys can be widely tuned without the detrimental defects that are often unavoidable in bulk materials, which have a much more limited tolerance to lattice mismatches. This class of nanomaterials could have a far-reaching impact on a wide range of photonic applications, including tunable lasers, solid-state lighting, artificial photosynthesis and new solar cells.},

   abstract = {Automated particle segmentation and feature analysis of experimental image data are indispensable for data-driven material science. Deep learning-based image segmentation algorithms are promising techniques to achieve this goal but are challenging to use due to the acquisition of a large number of training images. In the present work, synthetic images are applied, resembling the experimental images in terms of geometrical and visual features, to train the state-of-art Mask region-based convolutional neural networks to segment vanadium pentoxide nanowires, a cathode material within optical density-based images acquired using spectromicroscopy. The results demonstrate the instance segmentation power in real optical intensity-based spectromicroscopy images of complex nanowires in overlapped networks and provide reliable statistical information. The model can further be used to segment nanowires in scanning electron microscopy images, which are fundamentally different from the training dataset known to the model. The proposed methodology can be extended to any optical intensity-based images of variable particle morphology, material class, and beyond.},

   abstract = {In this work, we present a review of quantum dot (QD) material systems that allow us to obtain light emission in the telecom C-band at 1.55 µm. These epitaxial semiconductor nanostructures are of great technological interest for the development of devices for the generation of on-demand quanta of light for long-haul communication applications. The material systems considered are InAs QDs grown on InP, metamorphic InAs/InGaAs QDs grown on GaAs, InAs/GaSb QDs grown on Si, and InAsN QDs grown on GaAs. In order to provide a quantitative comparison of the different material systems, we carried out numerical simulations based on envelope function approximation to calculate the strain-dependant energy band profiles and the associated confined energy levels. We have also derived the eigenfunctions and the optical matrix elements for confined states of the systems. From the results of the simulations, some general conclusions on the strengths and weaknesses of each QD material system have been drawn, along with useful indications for the optimization of structural engineering aiming at single-photon emission in the telecom C-band.},

abstract = {Characterization of bonding surfaces can aid in both the design of a bond and in the failure analysis if an adhesion bond fails. Surface analysis requires the use of a number of analytical techniques including microscopic, spectroscopic, chemical and physical methods that provide different types information about the surface of a sample. The analysis is done to provide information about such characteristics as the chemical composition, the level of trace impurities, or the physical structure or appearance of the sampled region. Such information is of importance to researchers or manufacturers who must understand the materials in order to verify a theory or make a better product. In addition to surface-specific methods, this chapter describes other analytical techniques which can be applied to characterize the bulk properties of materials.}
