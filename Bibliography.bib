   abstract = {The local integration of III-Vs on Si is relevant for a wide range of applications in electronics and photonics, since it combines a mature and established materials platform with desired physical properties such as a direct and tunenable bandgap and high mobility. The large thermal expansion coefficient and lattice mismatch, however, pose a challenge for the direct growth of III-Vs on Si. In this paper we will review fabrication concepts to overcome this mismatch for the local integration of III-Vs on Si. In particular, we will briefly discuss processing methods based on aspect ratio trapping, nanowire growth, and template-assisted selective epitaxy. The focus of this review will be on the latter, where we will provide an overview of the different possibilities and embodiments of template-assisted selective epitaxy (TASE) and their promise for locally integrated active photonic devices.},

   abstract = {Here we investigate the growth of InAs nanowires on 〈111〉 Si substrates masked by SiO x using metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. We study 〈111〉 (axial) and 〈1-10〉 (radial) growth of InAs NWs by varying growth duration, temperature, group-III molar flows, V/III ratio, mask material, mask opening size, and inter-wire distance. We find that growth takes place without an In droplet and the process evolves through three successive phases: nucleation of an InAs cluster, followed by two distinct nanowire growth phases. These two growth phases have different axial and radial growth rates, which originate in a transition from having In supply dominated by the open Si area in the first phase towards an In supply from the vapor/oxide mask in the second growth phase. The linear relation found between nanowire length and diameter vs. time in the last growth phase indicates that 〈111〉 growth is not surface diffusion limited as is usually the case for catalyzed growth. A high yield of vertical nanowires is obtained if group-III flow is above and V/III ratio below threshold values, in addition to having an arsenic-terminated Si surface. Furthermore, we observe that 〈111〉 and 〈1-10〉 growth is surface kinetically limited below 520 °C and 540 °C, respectively, with activation energies of 20 and 6.5 kcal/mol. This difference in activation energies limits the selectivity of the 〈111〉 to 〈1-10〉 growth to 25:1 under optimized conditions, which must be considered when fabricating axially modulated structures. However, we find that by placing wires in large arrays it is possible to completely stop the 〈1-10〉 growth rate in favor of the 〈111〉 growth rate. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Here we present a monolithic InP on SOI platform to synergize the advantages of two mainstream photonic integration platforms: Si photonics and InP photonics. This monolithic InP/SOI platform is realized through the selective growth of both InP sub-micron wires and large dimension InP membranes on industry-standard (001)-oriented silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers. The epitaxial InP is in-plane, dislocation-free, site-controlled, intimately positioned with the Si device layer, and placed right on top of the buried oxide layer to form “InP-on-insulator”. These attributes allow for the realization of various photonic functionalities using the epitaxial InP, with efficient light interfacing between the III–V devices and the Si-based waveguides. We exemplify the potential of this InP/SOI platform for integrated photonics through the demonstration of lasers with different cavity designs including subwavelength wires, square cavities, and micro-disks. Our results here mark a critical step forward towards fully-integrated Si-based PICs.},

   abstract = {III-V Nanowires (NWs) grown with metal-organic chemical vapor deposition commonly show a polytypic crystal structure, allowing growth of structures not found in the bulk counterpart. In this paper we studied the radial overgrowth of pure wurtzite (WZ) GaAs nanowires and characterized the samples with high resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD) to reveal the crystal structure of the grown material. In particular, we investigated what happens when adjacent WZ NWs radially merge with each other by analyzing the evolution of XRD peaks for different amounts of radial overgrowth and merging. By preparing cross-sectional lamella samples we also analyzed the local crystal structure of partly merged NWs by transmission electron microscopy. Once individual NWs start to merge, the crystal structure of the merged segments is transformed progressively from initial pure WZ to a mixed WZ/ZB structure. The merging process is then modeled using a simple combinatorial approach, which predicts that merging of two or more WZ NWs will result in a mixed crystal structure containing WZ, ZB, and 4H. The existence large and relaxed segments of 4H structure within the merged NWs was confirmed by XRD, allowing us to accurately determine the lattice parameters of GaAs 4H. We compare the measured WZ and 4H unit cells with an ideal tetrahedron and find that both the polytypes are elongated in the c-axis and compressed in the a-axis compared to the geometrically converted cubic ZB unit cell.},

   abstract = {Indium Antimonide (InSb) is a semiconductor material with unique properties, that are suitable for studying new quantum phenomena in hybrid semiconductor-superconductor devices. The realization of such devices with defect-free InSb thin films is challenging, since InSb has a large lattice mismatch with most common insulating substrates. Here, the controlled synthesis of free-standing 2D InSb nanostructures, termed as “nanoflakes”, on a highly mismatched substrate is presented. The nanoflakes originate from the merging of pairs of InSb nanowires grown in V-groove incisions, each from a slanted and opposing \{111\}B facet. The relative orientation of the two nanowires within a pair, governs the nanoflake morphologies, exhibiting three distinct ones related to different grain boundary arrangements: no boundary (type-I), Σ3- (type-II), and Σ9-boundary (type-III). Low-temperature transport measurements indicate that type-III nanoflakes are of a relatively lower quality compared to type-I and type-II, based on field-effect mobility. Moreover, type-III nanoflakes exhibit a conductance dip attributed to an energy barrier pertaining to the Σ9-boundary. Type-I and type-II nanoflakes exhibit promising transport properties, suitable for quantum devices. This platform hosting nanoflakes next to nanowires and nanowire networks can be used to selectively deposit the superconductor by inter-shadowing, yielding InSb-superconductor hybrid devices with minimal post-fabrication steps.},

Temperature (940 K) and total pressure (20 hPa) were selected with this purpose in mind. It is shown that the behaviour of the binaries provides an understanding of the factors determining the deposition of the ternaries and that insights for selective growth on partially masked substrates can be gained from these data. In contrast to lnP and lnAs growth, the rates for the Ga binaries GaAs and GaP and the ternaries depend on the substrate orientation. The variation of the rates of the ternaries is very similar to that of the binary Ga constituents. More importantly, also the composition (Ga content) of the ternaries appears to track with this parameter and varies rather widely, particularly for GalnAs. In the case of selective embedded deposition the differences in rates between the different surfaces tend to be enhanced compared to those on unmasked substrates due to migration effects.},

Such energy dissipation overall is now at environmentally significant levels; the source of that dissipation is progressively shifting from logic operations to interconnect energies. Without the prospect of substantial reduction in energy per bit communicated, we cannot continue the exponential growth of our use of information. The physics of optics and optoelectronics fundamentally addresses both interconnect energy and bandwidth density, and optics may be the only scalable solution to such problems. Here we summarize the corresponding background, status, opportunities, and research directions for optoelectronic technology and novel optics, including subfemtojoule devices in waveguide and novel two-dimensional (2-D) array optical systems. We compare different approaches to low-energy optoelectronic output devices and their scaling, including lasers, modulators and LEDs, optical confinement approaches (such as resonators) to enhance effects, and the benefits of different material choices, including 2-D materials and other quantum-confined structures. With such optoelectronic energy reductions, and the elimination of line charging dissipation by the use optical connections, the next major interconnect dissipations are in the electronic circuits for receiver amplifiers, timing recovery, and multiplexing. We show we can address these through the integration of photodetectors to reduce or eliminate receiver circuit energies, free-space optics to eliminate the need for timing and multiplexing circuits (while also solving bandwidth density problems), and using optics generally to save power by running large synchronous systems. One target concept is interconnects from ∼1 cm to ∼10 m that have the same energy (∼10 fJ/bit) and simplicity as local electrical wires on chip.},

We show a novel hybrid approach in which preselected III−V single quantum dots in nanowires are transferred and integrated in silicon based photonic circuits. The quantum emitters maintain their high optical quality after integration as verified by measuring a low multiphoton probability of 0.07 ± 0.07 and emission line width as narrow as 3.45 ± 0.48 GHz. Our approach allows for optimum alignment of the quantum dot light emission to the fundamental waveguide mode resulting in very high coupling efficiencies. We estimate a coupling efficiency of 24.3 ± 1.7\% from the studied single-photon source to the photonic channel and further show by finite-difference time-domain simulations that for an optimized choice of material and design the efficiency can exceed 90\%. E xperiments on photons have played a key role in our understanding of quantum mechanics by probing the quantized nature of electromagnetic radiation. Since Linear Optical Quantum Computing (LOQC) 1 was proposed, there has been an ongoing effort to achieve a scalable platform for its realization. Few qubit operations have been shown 2,3 and up to eight photon entanglement has been achieved 4 using discrete optical components and parametric down conversion. Although many basic proof of principles have been demonstrated, a more scalable approach is needed for complex architectures. Recently, integrated photonics has gained significant interest as it offers scalability, robustness, and ease of use for on-chip quantum computation. 5−9 A LOQC system comprised of three main components: single photon generation, manipulation, and detection. Single-photons used in integrated photonic circuits are often generated using parametric down conversion or quantum dots (QD). As opposed to parametric down conversion, QDs are suitable for on-demand single photon generation 10 and narrow emission bandwidth, their emission wavelength can be tuned, 11−15 and they offer the possibility of on-chip electrical excitation. 16 As for the logical quantum gates, every discrete unitary operator can be realized using only mirrors and beam splitters. 17 This makes the integrated photonic platform very attractive due to the already available components for passive and active light manipulation. 18 In addition, for single photon detection, >90\% system efficiency has been achieved. 19 However, to realize an efficient LOQC system, it is required to interface all of these often incompatible technologies. Significant efforts have been put into realizing LOQC on-chip. For on-chip detection, efficient coupling of super-conducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPD) with dielectric waveguides has been demonstrated. 20,21 As for the gate operations, complex photonic circuits for quantum operations have been realized. 22,23 In addition, QDs have been coupled to photonic cavities, nanowires, waveguides, 24−26 and SNSPDs. 27 Fabricating low-loss III−V waveguides and selectively embedding single-quantum emitters is a challenge. 28,29 Moreover, growing superconducting films (for detectors) on these substrates often leads to low efficiency or high dark counts. 30 In this work, we present a novel hybrid platform through integration of III−V preselected single QDs embedded in nanowires within robust SiN photonic circuits.

   abstract = {The heterogeneous integration of micro- and nanoscale devices with on-chip circuits and waveguide platforms is a key enabling technology, with wide-ranging applications in areas including telecommunications, quantum information processing, and sensing. Pick and place integration with absolute positional accuracy at the nanoscale has been previously demonstrated for single proof-of-principle devices. However, to enable scaling of this technology for realization of multielement systems or high throughput manufacturing, the integration process must be compatible with automation while retaining nanoscale accuracy. In this work, an automated transfer printing process is realized by using a simple optical microscope, computer vision, and high accuracy translational stage system. Automatic alignment using a cross-correlation image processing method demonstrates absolute positional accuracy of transfer with an average offset of <40 nm (3σ < 390 nm) for serial device integration of both thin film silicon membranes and single nanowire devices. Parallel transfer of devices across a 2 × 2 mm2 area is demonstrated with an average offset of <30 nm (3σ < 705 nm). Rotational accuracy better than 45 mrad is achieved for all device variants. Devices can be selected and placed with high accuracy on a target substrate, both from lithographically defined positions on their native substrate or from a randomly distributed population. These demonstrations pave the way for future scalable manufacturing of heterogeneously integrated chip systems.},

The study is based on an extensive deep-level transient spectroscopy investigation, carried out on GaAs pin diodes grown on Si and on GaAs (that differ in the dislocation density), with and without embedded QDs. The original results described in this paper demonstrate that: (a) we were able to identify four different defects within the device grown on Si (three electron and one hole traps) and one defect (hole trap) in the device on GaAs, common to both samples; (b) all the majority carrier traps identified are located near midgap, i.e. are efficient non-radiative recombination centers; (c) such defects are absent (or non-detectable) in the sample grown on GaAs substrate, having a very low dislocation density; (d) the presence of QDs does not result in additional defects within the semiconductor material; (e) the analysis of the capture kinetics revealed that two of the identified traps are related to point defects, whereas the other two traps can be associated with point defects located near a dislocation; (f) a comparison with previous reports indicate that the detected traps are related to native III-As defects, or to oxygen-related complexes.},

   abstract = {In the present talk we discuss the application of Template-Assisted Selective Epitaxy (TASE) for the monolithic integration of III-V active photonic devices on silicon. The main concept of TASE relies on the guided growth of III-Vs within a confined oxide template. At one extremity of the template there is access to silicon to start the nucleation, and subsequently it is the template which guides the growth progression. This decoupling of the resulting geometry from the growth mode and substrate orientation, results in a larger processing window as we no longer rely on the growth conditions to tune the geometry, as well as a number of other advantages. A further unique advantage of TASE for silicon photonics applications is that it allows for the truly local integration of III-V material at precisely defined positions, since the location of the III-V may be defined with nm-scale precision in the same lithographic step as silicon passives. TASE was originally developed for electronics, but in recent years we have expanded it to enable several photonic devices. In the present talk, I will discuss our work on GaAs and InP microdisk lasers fabricated by either direct growth or via the use of micro-substrates. These devices show lasing at room temperature around 870 nm with thresholds of about 10 pJ/pulse. We also explore the use of metal-clad cavities for further light confinement.},

InAs, GaAs, and InGaAs layers were included in laterally grown InP structures and characterized to show abrupt interfaces and crystalline material. The orientation of the templates and the substrate is chosen so that a flat vertical facet appears at the growth front allowing for the HJs to be horizontal, unlike typical planar epitaxy. This enables the design of recently proposed novel electronic HJ devices like triple-HJ tunnel field-effect transistors.},

   abstract = {The selective area growth technique, confined epitaxial lateral overgrowth (CELO), enables the growth of lateral III-V heterojunctions integrated on mismatched substrates. In CELO, effective control of facet shapes, as well as defect-free growths are essential to fabricating high-quality nanostructures with custom geometries. Here, the effects of growth temperature, V/III ratio, template alignments, and substrate orientations on the observed facets and defect densities in CELO grown InP and related materials on InP substrates are investigated. The nanostructure facets and defects are determined using a combination of plan-view and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy. For homoepitaxial CELO growth on InP (100) substrates, growth temperatures below 575∘C, and high V/III ratios of 450 aid in increasing the surface areas of the \{111\}B facets, while reducing defect densities. Further, by changing template alignments, the effective areas of overgrowth can be tuned, and defects can be lowered, with templates aligned along [01¯0] yielding the largest defect-free areas. By aligning templates in the [1¯10] orientation on a (110) InP substrate, near defect-free overgrowth with perfectly flat perpendicular single (11¯ 0) facets can be achieved. This is an essential feature to enable the growth of lateral III-V heterojunctions, as is demonstrated by growing InP/InGaAs CELO heterojunctions with \{110\} facets.},

   abstract = {InGaAs is a potential candidate for Si replacement in upcoming advanced technological nodes because of its excellent electron transport properties and relatively low interface defect density in dielectric gate stacks. Therefore, integrating InGaAs devices with the established Si platforms is highly important. Using template-assisted selective epitaxy (TASE), InGaAs nanowires can be monolithically integrated with high crystal quality, although the mechanisms of group III incorporation in this ternary material have not been thoroughly investigated. Here we present a detailed study of the compositional variations of InGaAs nanostructures epitaxially grown on Si(111) and Silicon-on-insulator substrates by TASE. We present a combination of XRD data and detailed EELS maps and find that the final Ga/In chemical composition depends strongly on both growth parameters and the growth facet type, leading to complex compositional sub-structures throughout the crystals. We can further conclude that the composition is governed by the facet-dependent chemical reaction rates at low temperature and low V/III ratio, while at higher temperature and V/III ratio, the incorporation is transport limited. In this case we see indications that the transport is a competition between Knudsen flow and surface diffusion.},

   abstract = {Selective area epitaxy is a powerful growth technique that has been used to produce III–V semiconductor nanowire and nanomembrane arrays for photonic and electronic applications. The incorporation of a heterostructure such as quantum wells (QWs) brings new functionality and further broadens their applications. Using InP nanowires and nanomembranes as templates, we investigate the growth of InAsP QWs on these pure wurtzite nanostructures. InAsP QWs grow both axially and laterally on the nanowires and nanomembranes, forming a zinc blende phase axially and wurtzite phase on the sidewalls. On the non-polar \{100\} sidewalls, the radial QW selectively grows on one sidewall which is located at the semi-polar 〈11〉 A side of the axial QW, causing the shape evolution of the nanowires from hexagonal to triangular cross section. For nanomembranes with \{100\} sidewalls, the radial QW grows asymmetrically on the \{100\} facet, destroying their symmetry. In comparison, nanomembranes with \{110\} sidewalls are shown to be an ideal template for the growth of InAsP QWs, thanks to the uniform QW formation. These QWs emit strongly in the near IR region at room temperature and their emission can be tuned by changing their thickness or composition. These findings enrich our understanding of the QW growth, which provides new insights for heterostructure design in other III–V nanostructures.},

TMAH solutions containing butanol-2 and ternary solutions composed of TMAH + Triton + alcohol, used in the experiments, had not been investigated before. The phenomena associated with the presence of surfactant and alcohol additives in etching solutions were analyzed and the mechanism including co-solving of surfactant molecules in alcohol and interplay in the adsorbing mechanism was proposed. The influence of these phenomena on the etching rates and morphologies of Si(1 0 0) and Si(1 1 0) was discussed. The addition of alcohol, especially butanol-2, to a TMAH solution resulted in significant improvement of the etched surface finish. The roughness of Si(1 1 0) surfaces etched in TMAH + butanol solutions was superior to the roughness of the surfaces etched in TMAH + Triton. The best surface roughness parameters of Si(1 1 0) (Ra = 0.0322 μm and RMS = 0.0549 μm), measured with an optical profilometer on the area of 1.6 mm × 1.6 mm, were achieved after etching in a ternary solution of TMAH + Triton + butanol. This solution appears to be a good candidate in applications where high quality finish of etched surfaces is required on a substantially high area. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {InP/InGaAs and InGaAs/InP interfaces in heterostructures grown by metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE) have been studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cross-sectional TEM 002 dark field images of the direct (InP-InGaAs) and inverted (InGaAs-InP) interfaces revealed a great difference in abruptness. Whereas the direct interface is always well defined and flat, the inverted one is compositionally graded and shows surface undulations. InP-InGaAs heterostructures were studied for different layer thicknesses and phosphine flow rates. The results indicate that this effect originates more from the substitution of arsenic by phosphorus atoms in subsurface InGaAs monolayers rather than from As carryover to the InP layer. The strong As-P exchange observed over several InGaAs monolayers is related to the large difference in chemical bond strength between Ga-As and Ga-P. This is supported by comparison with InP/InAlAs/InP and InP/In 1-xGa xAs yP 1-y/InP (0.1<x<0.4) heterostructures. The inverted InAlAs/InP interface is much more abrupt than the InGaAs/InP one and does not show any surface undulations. Furthermore, the In 1-xGa xAs yP 1-y/InP interface surface undulations increase with x composition. These results, valid for our experimental configuration, indicate that MOVPE grown InGaAs/InP interfaces can be improved by using very low hydride flow during the switching sequence. © 2002 American Institute of Physics. © 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

It is found that the effective V/III ratio is reduced at least by a factor of two within the nanotube templates compared to the outside, detectable by changes in the growth facet morphology. The reduced V/III ratio originates from the different transport mechanisms for the As and In precursor species; As and In species are both transported by Knudsen diffusion in the vapor, but an additional contribution of In surface diffusion reduces the V/III ratio. The results reveal the interplay of growth parameters, crystal facets and template geometry and thus are generally applicable for nanoscale selective epitaxy.},

A high degree of morphological control allows for GaSb nanostructures with critical dimensions down to 20 nm. Detailed investigation of growth parameters reveals that the GaSb growth rate is governed by the desorption processes of an Sb surface layer and, in turn, is insensitive to changes in material transport efficiency. The GaSb crystal structure is typically zinc-blende with a low density of rotational twin defects, and even occasional twin-free structures are observed. Hall/van der Pauw measurements are conducted on 20 nm-thick GaSb nanostructures, revealing high hole mobility of 760 cm2/(V s), which matches literature values for high-quality bulk GaSb crystals.
